           <center><h1>superstrong, superstupid Shamshounians</h1></center>
            
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        But I don't wish to discuss my experience with the plebian hoarde, the proud KnowNothings, who live day-to-day, chasing fuzzy feelings, lost, bewildered, confused, like frightened animals. I'd rather discuss Shamshounianism.
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Why are you so personally invested in Shamshounianism?" Uriah Bleu asked me in his southern accent.
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Well, to start, I have a handful of cousins and cousins once-removed who've been murdered by these maniacs."
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Uriah nodded slowly. "In Persia?"
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Yeah."
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Your family's sort of aristocratic royalty, right?"
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "What's that got to do with it?"
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I mean, when your bloodline possesses some dominant social status, there tends to be moments in the ole family tree where some piece of property, incesnsed about their legal non-personhood, decides to enact revenger against the hand that feeds and any do-wells within stabbing distance," and Uriah pantomimed having his own throat slit.
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Well, unlike <I>some people's</I> ancestry, my family never <i>owned</i> anybody; the Shamshounian'sychos don't care who they kill: they kill mid-level managers and assistant associates to the secretary of the city sanitary department. They're like mad curs from Kur who've grown a tumor on their brain and need to be put down."
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Your family aren't mid-level managers, are they?" Uriah said.
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "That's <I>irrelevent</I>,"I said.
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Shamshoun is a tale for xenophobes. A man with superstrength (inexplicitly caused by his long, uncut hair) comes to lose his strength due to infatuation, marriage, and trust in a foreign woman from the occupying powers. She has his hair cut in the middle of the night, as secret police sweep Shamshoun away in chains, blinding him, castrating him, and making him a spectacle of public humiliation by tethering his naked body to pillars of the foreign invaders' holiest temple.
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Can't trust them <I>ferrinerrs</I>," Uriah said.
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            And how does this tale end? Ahuramazda grants Shamshoun a miracle :- one final, climactic act, where the humiliated and mutilated Shamshoun momentarily regains his superstrength so he can use the chains that bind him to pull down the pillars to which he is chained, causing the temple roof to collapse, killing all the most important foreign leaders in the occupying powers (as well as Shamshoun) in a ter[r][o]rific act of massMurder-suicide. 
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                "That's strange," Uriah said. "I've never heard of Shamshounians using their superstrength to commit massMurder-suicide. Everytime I heard about 'em, they're using machien guns or homemmade, improvised explosions."
                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I leant over and whispered in Uriah's ear. "That's because Shamshoun is a make-believe fairy tale beloved by <I>idiots</I>."
