      <p>
      Once there was a scientist. This scientist realized that the gravitational force was less about matter being intrinsically attracted to one another, and more about matter warping the surrounding space. This scientist had a cornucopia of opinions. One of them follows:
      <p><I>
      “It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom. Without this it goes to wrack and ruin without fail.”
      </I><p>
      This sentiment certainly resonated with me as a child, growing up. Why must the instructional master harass me so? Why must they handcuff my focus and curiosity to the solving of menial tasks totally alienated from my sense of existential purpose? 
      <p>
      I entered the field of education to change education. To redivert its focus toward a pedagogy more in line with the great scientist. We shall cease trying to yank the plant upward against its will. Instead, we will feed it all the nutrients we can, ensure it receives plenty of water, and that it lacks not for sunlight and carbon dioxide!
      <p>
      Then I begin to learn a painful lesson.
      <p>
      This freedom was not for everyone. Many youth, when handed the gift of freedom, squander it toward frivolity and sloth. 
      <p>
      Perhaps there was a reason skools were designed as such. Perhaps it wasn’t simply a nefarious capitalistik plot to brainwash the worker class into being good, lil’, obedient factory-workers. Perhaps, if done elsewise, chaos would reign supreme and no learning would occur whatsoever.
      <p>
      But in this campaign to tame the wild beast of the common child, there is serious collateral damage. The brilliant minds who would best prosper under the above-quoted ideology (the one metaphorizing about [autotrophs] in need of freedom) were crushed under the tyrannical yoke of this petty micromanaging.
      <p>
      This is why I left regular, mainstream education. This is why I founded Traveling Mouth Band University.
      <p>
      Traveling Mouth Band University is a charter skool, funded by publik tax monies. In conjunction with federal regulations surrounding the special education concept of “Least Restrictive Environment”, our institution of learning is focused on serving a special class of student that has been traditionally ignored: the profoundly gifted. These students, persons plagued with a brain capable of reasoning better than 97% of their like-aged peers, have mistakenly been misidentified as individuals who do not need extra help. But as psychological knowledge regarding the human individual increases, scientists have learned that there are special particularities in this population that require specific pedagogical maneuvers to best serve these students born with a genetic condition they did not choose.
      <p>
      If a student is identified as being in need of our special services, we have an institutional framework that can provide the Least Restrictive Environment in a fashion unimaginable to all other skools. 
      <p>
      By eschewing the specious imperative to construct luxurious architectural structures whilst concomitantly funding a whole fleet of hyperspecialists with incredibly narrow expertise, TMB University is financially capable of providing state-of-the-art technologies that permit students to surpass the constrictions of fortress-like centralized geographic locations in favour of untethered locomotions in both the virtual and tangible realms. 
      <p>
      Moreover, we have abolished the archaic form of behaviour management that masquerades as objective academic assessment (“grades”) and replaced it with a points system employed by artificially intelligent algorithms under the operating psychological principles that underlie the operant conditioning subset that is positive reinforcement. When students perform brave, autonomous, thoughtful, collaborative, high-quality eduProjekts™, AI-allocated points have the palpable effect of providing students with the means to have much-desired materials and tools Nyle™DroneDelivered to their location within a fraction of a day. Furthermore, thanks to corporate sponsorship and federal subsidies, high-performing students also have limited access to robo-ubers™ that can ferry them to a location of their choosing.
      <p>
      As founder of Traveling Mouth Band University, I am thrilled to announce to the waking world that education has finally left the era of the mass-scale smoke-stack assembly-line interchangeable parts factory. We are no longer hampered by the small-minded whims of the itinerant skoolmaster in a one-room skoolhouse. The great young minds of today can actively prepare themselves (and one another) for greatness. Not by waiting for tomorrow. But by being unfettered to create today.
