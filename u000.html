    <h1>.000</h1>

<p>  <span class="redstart">.</span><span class="red hoverable" id="uriah">Uriah Bleu</span><span class="redend">.</span> felt stressed and confused. His rankings at Traveling Mouth Band University <span class="white-emphasis">(TMB Uni)</span> had suddenly plummeted, apparently in response to a mass influx of new enrollees out in AMABALA. And now Uriah's Triple-A <span class="white-emphasis">(automatic algorithmic advisor)</span> kept barking out orders to contribute to a myriad of eduProjekts, s'posedly to help him reclaim his ratio of the total EspecialPoint 'conomy. </p>
    
    <p>So, here was Uriah, on bicycle, pedaling from the Xenia library with a wood-carved eduArtifact to install at a makeshift eduShrine behind a random cinderblock wall beside the traintracks. </p>

<img src ="images/primefactortable.png" class="prime1">

<p> At the "shrine", he found a cinderblock wall that had been completely papered over by crayon drawings. And a large block of clay.</p>
          
<div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"> <img src="images/uriah232.png"><B>Uriah</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">  Who put all these crayon drawings here?
</span></div></div>

<div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"><img src="images/HectorAAA.png"><B>A A A</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">
    This question cannot be answered at this moment. But to receive maximum EspecialPoint acquisition, it is recommended that you carve prime factor trees into tablets that you make out of the clay block. </span></div></div>

    <div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"> <img src="images/uriah232.png"><B>Uriah</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">  Prime Factor Trees? Isn't that a lil' <I>elementary?</I>
    </span></div></div>

    <div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"><img src="images/HectorAAA.png"><B>A A A</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">
       I am merely a Triple-A, designed to help you maximize your EspecialPoint acquisition and bolster your AllAround-StudentRankings. </span></div></div>

<p> Uriah thought about arguing with the 'bot, but as he procrastinated the recommended task at hand, he begin to see his rankings drift downward and his EspecialPoint balance <I>stagnate</I>.</p>

<p> So he went over, and began unwrapping the block of clay.</p>

<h1>.001</h1>

<p> "Wow, that's a lot of prime number isomers," said <span class="orangestart">.</span><span class="orange hoverable" id="khali">Khali Pavlavi</span><span class="orangeend">.</span>, picking up two clay tablets. </p>

<img src ="images/claytablets-33isomers.png" class="prime1">

<p> "Yeah," Uriah said. "My Triple-A told me to make every prime number isomer up to 100."</p>
</p>

<img src ="images/claytablets-100isomers.png" class="prime1">

<p> "I wondered why it told me to leave all this clay here," Khali said. "I paid for it with my own EspecialPoints." </p>

<p> "Yeah, well, I still don't understand. Prime Number Factor Trees is kid stuff," Uriah said. "This is s'posed to be a <I>gifted</I> skool.</p>

<p> Khali shrugged. "I don't know. They had me do 'em too, except mine were crayon drawings. Very <I>explicit</I> instructions to cover every picometer of paper with crayon. Supreme waxy wonderfulness! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to decorate some bicycles for a big parade."
    
    <h1>.002</h1>

<p>The next morning, Uriah found himself typing scripts for a ficitious proRasslin' company called <span class="proper-noun">Moon Championship Wrestling</span>, an organization devoted to entertaining indentured servants from Antarctica. 

<img src ="images/timhaught-v-jackbone.png" class="prime1">

<div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"> <img src="images/timhaught232.png"><B>Tim Haught</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">  Tonight, Jack Bone, I'm going to bust your head wide open, bleed you of your crimson red blood, and make your white facepaint radiate pink!
</span></div></div>

<div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"><img src="images/jackbone232.png"><B>Jack Bone</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">
   I laugh at your pathetic attempts to intimidate me. Pain doesn't frighten me; pain INSPIRES me. </span></div></div>

   <p><span class="redstart">.</span><span class="red hoverable" id="uriah">Uriah</span><span class="redend">.</span> didn't know what he was doing. He had never even watched proRasslin' before. And for the life of him, he could not understand why the Triple-A was having him do such mess. </p>

   <p> Then Uriah suddenly received a thought-text from <span class="yellowstart">.</span><span class="yellow hoverable" id="hector">Hector Chavez</span><span class="yellowend">.</span>.</p>

   <div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"><img src="images/MCW.gif"><B>Hector</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">
    Hey! Thanks for participating in my MoonChampionshipWrestling eduProjekt. It really is greatly appreciated.</span></div></div>

   <div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"> <img src="images/uriah232.png"><B>Uriah</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">  In all honesty, I have no idea why I'm helping. My Triple-A keeps telling me to do random stuff. 
</span></div></div>

<div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"><img src="images/MCW.gif"><B>Hector</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">
   Yeah, the algos have a mind of their own, don't they?</span></div></div>

   <div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"><img src="images/MCW.gif"><B>Hector</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">
    You must be new to BeaverCreek, right? Because I haven't met you. So I'm sending a roboUber to bring you over to my house. My treat. </span></div></div>

<p> Before Uriah could respond, his Triple-A emerged in his field of vision.</p>

<div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"><img src="images/HectorAAA.png"><B>A A A</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">
   It is in your supreme EP interests to entangle yourself with this individual, according to my updated calculations.  </span></div></div>

   <div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"> <img src="images/uriah232.png"><B>Uriah</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">  Updated calculations!??!?!
</span></div></div>

<div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"><img src="images/HectorAAA.png"><B>A A A</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">
    Reality is a dynamic phenomenon, not subject to a static stillness that is easily predicted or forecast from afar. </span></div></div>

    <p> So when the roboUber arrived, Uriah entered.</p>

    <h1>.003</h1>

    <p> Hector's house was a <span class="censored">[faeces]</span>hole, with the lawn a meter high, gone to weed, and a cracked concrete driveway covered in motor oil stains. The bushes were overgrown and attempting to eat the front porch, which was a euphemism for «rectangular slab of concrete littered with broken plastic chairs and disembowled rusty bicycles.» </p>

        <img src ="images/hectorhouse.gif">

<p> A six-jaar old half-brother of Hector (<span class="censored">[redacted]</span>) let Uriah inside, and directed him upstairs.  </p>

<p> "Greetings, Uriah Bleu of TEJAS," <span class="yellowstart">.</span><span class="yellow hoverable" id="hector">Hector</span><span class="yellowend">.</span> said. "I've prepared some yeshi tea in honour of your presence."
</p>

        <img src ="images/yeshitea-hectorhouse.gif" class="prime2">

<p> "Ummm," Uriah said. "That's a little blasphemous, don't ya think?"</p>

        <p> Hector looked at the boiling cauldron of water atop the electric hotplate and then back at Uriah. He furrowed his brow. "In the EUB <span class="white-emphasis">(Europa Universal Bevy)</span>, this is a long-standing tradition.</p>

        <p> "My apologies," Uriah said. "My grandma would <I>flip</I> if she saw this."</p>

<P> "Oh, she must be one of those <I>other yeshians</I>," Hector said, turning off the power switch. "You like this flattop stove? My last one broke, so my Triple-A surprised me by NyleDroning™ me replacement parts, except I had to assemble the electronic circuitry myself. Sautering and wire-stripping and clamping and all that."</P>

<p>    "Surprised you?" Uriah said.</p>

<p> "Yeah, I didn't even know it was broke. I wonder if it was some sort of planned obsolescence thing. Or maybe to force me to learn about electricity. I've always sort of ignored those details." </p>

<h1>.004</h1>

<p> "What's that tea made out of?" <span class="redstart">.</span><span class="red hoverable" id="uriah">Uriah</span><span class="redend">.</span> asked. </p>

<p> "Dried leaves and flower petals from different plants," Hector said. "It's a medley promoted by an author I read." </p>

<P>Hector used a small ladle to fill shallow hand-sculpted cups, and gave one to Uriah.</P>

<p>"In communion with the great Ground of Being may you be invigorated with the sacred ephermeral breath. </p>

<p> "Ummm, right back at ya," Uriah said.</p>

<p> And they drank.</p>

<h1>.005</h1>

<div class="dialogue-box"><div class="character-info"><img src="images/HectorAAA.png"><B>A A A</B> </div><div class="dialogue"><span class = "dialogue">
        It is recommended that you draw stick figure animations for Hector's «Sunday Lunar Madness» show </span></div></div>

<p> But Uriah felt a difference in his response to the Triple-A's command. He wasn't annoyed or irritated. He felt proud. He sensed an overwhelming emotion of <I>gratitude</I> to be <I>asked</I>> to be part of this incredible project. He was surprised to feel this sense of cosmic oneness with all of existence. </p>

<p> And under this state, Uriah crafted animations for Hector's proRasslin' projekt. </p>
