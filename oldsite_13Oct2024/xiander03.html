    A few days later, Xiander wouldn’t get out of bed.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    There was this dream he had. It lasted for a long time, was highly emotionally charged, and involved many transitions. Many subplots. Many changes of scenery. He laid in bed, grabbed a nearby spiral notebook, and began covering the pages with ink. The pages became heavy, laden in ink. Xiander found it terribly satisfying. As he wrote about his dream, he remembered more. And more. And more. He filled fifteen pages, writing the details, analyzing, and considering the consequences of a single night of dreaming.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    But he didn’t rise out of bed.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Xiander, are you okay?” his mother asked.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “I think I have the flu.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    She checked his temperature, but of course it was within the confines of normal. Within the parameters of the presumed to be healthy.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Xiander could hear his parents arguing from the living room.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “I think we should call a therapist,” his mother said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “My health insurance doesn’t cover psychotherapy,” his father said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Well, we need to do <I>something</I>.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “The skool will handle it. They have built in measures to deal with this sort of thing.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Tāo! They are sending over <I><U>children</U></I>.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “I hate to break it to you, but there are a good number of studies that indicate parental influence to be negligible at this age. Peers shape the child. They set the norms.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “So we do nothing?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Then Xiander couldn’t hear anything.

        Xiander was asleep. Strange geometric shapes drifted across the plane, transmogrifying in shape and surface. Then he awoke and saw Winfield sitting before him.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Rise and shine, beautiful,” Winfield said.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “My parents let you in?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Winfield shrugged. “I let myself in. So how’s the gulch? How's the depression?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Xiander said nothing.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Winfield threw a spiral notebook at Xiander. “Want to write down your dreams? I’ve been reading your twisted, dark phantasies.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Xiander said nothing, but reached underneath his pillow to find a ballpoint inkpen. He wrote about the geometric figures, the movement, the in-dream understanding that it had something to do with music. The music of spheres. The melody of day-to-day existence. Then, whilst writing about this, Xiander remembered a previous forgotten aspect of his dream. The idea that Andy was a robot, and the internal cavity underneath his chest was a hollow metal barrel with cogs and wheels, pulling bits of string and rope, sticky tack and white liquid epoxy. 
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Xiander wrote and he wrote. Winfield waited.

        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Why are you here?” Xiander asked. “I thought you were at war with the algorithmic infringement on humanoid free will?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “That was old me,” Winfield said. “I barely know the guy.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Cute.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “If there’s anyone I trust less than <I>current me</I>, it’s <I>old me</I>.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Okay. So now you care about EspecialPoints? About rankings? In a cold, heartless universe unconcerned by our welfare? A universe that would birth a monster like your older sister?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “What?!?” Winfield sang, as if Xiander was utterly insane. “<I><U>That’s</I></U> your interpretation of reality?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Xiander stared cold-faced. “No. That was your interpretation of reality.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Winfield shook his head. “I really don’t remember ever thinking that.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Cute.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “So… I hear Mars gave you [their] voice.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Stop.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “What?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Stop. I don’t want to hear it.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “What? We are merely flesh, blood, and bone. Protein molecules folded over by hypercomplex electromagnetic interactions. Prisoners of predestination.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Didn’t you once tell me that man was not an exponential derivative?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Me?” Winfield scoffed. “I think you are confusing me with someone else.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Cute.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Winfield rolled a filterless cigarello, as Xiander finished writing in his spiral notebook.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Can I smoke in here?” Winfield asked. “I mean, it already smells like an ashtray in your house.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Fukk no,” Xiander said. “They’ll assume <I>I’m</I> smoking it. You go outside.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Winfield put the rolled paper cylinder behind his ear. “I can wait. It’s not like I’m <I>addicted</I> or anything.”
