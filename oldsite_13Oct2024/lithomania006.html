    The rocks were laid atop a blue tarp in the center of Hector's backyard. A whole team was assembled. Andrew and Jakob received the rocks, whilst <mark class = "mark3">Luuk</mark> and Hector loaded the rocks. The cyclists were all sorts of people: Luuk’s party friends, Jakob’s wrestling buddies, and a number of girls with whom Andrew ran cross-country.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Luuk brought «lunatic lichens» for [him] and Hector to chew. This made rock excavation more interesting.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Wow, this rock is so smooth,” Luuk said, rubbing it with his finger before passing it to Hector.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Yeah,” Hector said, barely able to concentrate on anything but the one task at hand.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    As the rocks piled atop the blue tarp, Andrew and Jakob began constructing a 25-square meter area using tape measures, stakes, and string. Then they began scraping the spongy topsoil on the perimeter to find a sturdier base upon which they began piling the rocks.
