                The drive from Marfa to Alpine down FS-90 is a half-hour of nothingness. Brazil was very much intoxicated on suhtawree, which has a nasty habit of making folks transport themselves from total waking consciousness to bizarre microdreams. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                One moment, Brazil is the commander of his car, alone.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                One moment, Brazil is the commander of his spaceship. seated next to an cybernetic alien companion. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “How far are we ‘til our destination?” the cybernetic alien asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It is hard to know,” Brazil said. “For destination implies destiny and I am not certain that I am destined to arrive.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Because you are destined for elsewhere?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I am not certain that I believe in destiny. This false dichotomy betwixt destiny and freedom seems like a computational limitation of the human brain and sensory organ system hardware capabilities.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Interesting,” the cybernetic alien said. “I view reality as simple molecules accelerating as they interact with gravitational, electromagnetic, and strong/weak nuclear forces. But perhaps I am incorrect? Reality is crazy.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Brazil blinked and found himself opening a door. He was in a house that did not exist, but his mind told him it was his childhood bedroom. There, sitting on the bed, was a sister he never knew existed. She was scratching marks on a notebook.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What are you doing?” Brazil asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Making an ancient symbolic language for a skool projekt.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh?” Brazil said. “That’s interesting.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yeah, but I think it’s making me sick.” And then she grabbed her stomach.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What’s wrong?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I think I accidentally wrote out a prehistoric spell…” and then she started moaning in agony. Brazil touched her back, uncertain of what to do. He picked up her notebook that she was writing upon. He tried to make sense of the symbols; they seemed so familiar. But they kept whirling and moving around, whenever he attempted to focus on any symbol, they fled. Then Brazil realized: I must be dreaming. Oh! This is lucid dreaming!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Brazil stood up and the windows opened up and he drove through the window to fly. But before he progressed suddenly his face SMASHED INTO A BRICK WALL OF RESISTANCE. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                A moment before Brazil lost total consciousness, he realized that he’d crashed the car.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
