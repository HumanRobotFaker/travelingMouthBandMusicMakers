    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  After cleaning up the debris above the bedrock, Andrew and Hector set to the task of breaking the impasse. Andrew used a powerdrill loaded with diamond bits to create a line of small holes in the rock. Then Hector loaded feathers-and-wedges into the holes, before the two of them took turns hammering the feathers-and-wedges deeper. Eventually, the bedrock began cracking.

        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp They drilled more lines of holes. Hammered more feathers-and-wedges. Eventually they were able to chip away at certain sections of bedrock and use the mattock to begin pulling apart the broken rock.
    
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  What happened next cannot be verified by anyone but Andrew & Hector, as it was before Traveling Mouth Band University mandated students wear iContactsâ„¢ and incentivized the creek-recording of all peripersonal audiovisual stimuli. They had MOBs, so we can assure they were there, due to electromagnetic reception-and-distribution tower pings. But beyond that is left to utter speculation and the testimonies of those two teenage boys.
