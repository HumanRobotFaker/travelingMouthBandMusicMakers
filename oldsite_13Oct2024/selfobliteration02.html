                Hector crawled over to the edge of the blacktop, where the elementary skool playground dropped down into a drainage ditch, and vomited this red poison onto some half-buried tree roots. He wiped his gross hand on the grass, and then his jeans, and crawled out of the ditch with his brain dangling above his head like a helium-filled balloon on a string. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Woah…” Hector said. “Everything feels buhhhhhh-zarrrrrrr.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Winfield nodded. “Got that pixelated vision, eh?” And he smiled with all his teeth. “Excuse me for a moment.” Winfield then crawled into the ditch to vomit himself.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Hector didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know <I>what to think</I>.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Winfield returned and shook his head. “That feels better.” Then he looked in the direction that Hector looked. “Don’t you feel better?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The pit of death and despair that had grown steadily more and more intense on his insides was no longer there. “Yes,” Hector said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Winfield looked around in a dramatic circle. “This skool wasn’t so bad. It wasn’t a needle-infested trash heap like Tanknee [Junior High Skool], am I right?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Hector wasn’t sure. “I think we have different memories.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Winfield held up an index finger. “I suspect that you may be correct. Different individual memories. Different memorial bits assembled, coloured, and shaved into shapes to fit into an aesthetic, narrative <I>time-line</I>.” He smiled with all his teeth again. “Our own little sculpture masterpieces that can only be seen inside our heads.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Hector tried to look inside his head, but all he saw was the back of his skull.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Winfield rubbed his hands together with great, grand gestures. “I can barely feel my hands rubbing together,” he said. “I most certainly cannot feel the heat from the friction.” He stopped rubbing his hands and looked directly at Hector. “That means we’re dreaming, right? That’s a sign we’re dreaming? That we can’t feel the heat when we rub our hands together?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Hector nodded. “That’s a usual sign. Although that doesn’t mean we’re dreaming.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “But maybe we are? How do you know we’re not dreaming? That this isn’t all one, big dream?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Hector closed his eyes. He’d thought these thoughts before, but he wasn’t interested in this discussion. The moment after he closed his eyes, he saw a shade of black-green sweep over his field of vision.Then the green colour bubbled, stretched, and ripped open to reveal an XYZ room.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Britni was there. She had angelic wings sprouting out of her shoulders. She wore a white brassiere and she turned around.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Will you cut off these things?” she asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Why?” Hector said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                She looked back and smiled. “You put them here and I don’t want them.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                So Hector pulled up his hand, suddenly armed with a hacksaw, and began running the serrated blade against the nubs of the wings.
            <BR><BR><BR><BR>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Hector opened his eyes.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Winfield was nearby, grasping his hands onto a tetherball pole, and leaning back, feeling the force of his body’s weight against his hands. Hector found a similar tetherball pole and mimicked Winfield’s actions.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Were you dream-portaling?” Winfield asked. “Like you close your eyes and you’re automatically in a dream that you sort of control, but sort of don’t?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Hector stopped mimicking and stood straight up. “How many times have you done this?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Winfield repositioned his feet and then began swinging slowly on the tetherball pole, in a circular orbit. “I’m a verifiable vampire,” he said. “I think I can feel my canine teeth growing pointier and pointier.”
            	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I bet you can’t even see your image in your mirror,” Hector said. “And Hector visualized himself blowing up, exploding into a zillion pieces, with each piece gradually losing its vividness, its brightness, its opaqueness. Until it was translucent, transparent, and then… nonexistent. “Man, it would be really crazy to be wearing our iContacts™ right now.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Yeah,” Winfield said. “Until you get expelled [from TMB].”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Hector shrugged. “Skool is bullshit. Whether it’s brain-measuring, elitist, freedom-skool, or…” and then Hector lost his train of thought. He was drawn into the grid-nature of the elementary skool’s brick wall, following each trail of thought, feeling this strong sensation of <I>entendre</I>, existential entendre that a metaphor was literal and he had discovered an ancient secret of unbelievable magnitude.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Let’s promenade,” Winfield said, touching Hector’s shoulder. Winfield walked down a short bike path to an adjacent neighbourhood and Hector followed.
