    “There are dreams before lucidity and dreams after lucidity,” Hector announced to the crowd of eight, as they drank their yeefass. “Before lucidity, dreams are a chaos of narrative tension: nonsensical imperatives of great import, anxiety about being unable to fulfill s’posed requirements, and a sea of characters whose very faces and personalities shift and transform at any given moment.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    He paused.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “After lucidity is something else altogether”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Tell us more,” Andy said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    But Hector would not.

            The parties continued every night. It was summer, after all. Even when no bonfire was planned, a fire, in some form or fashion, was cultivated. Andy kept a metal barrell into the back of his pickup truck, just in case there was no other suitable spot to cultivate the flames. 
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
         
The night of the first barrell fire was when Jakob and Luuk declared Andy to be the «Bellipotentate of Lithomania». 
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
         
“Lead us, oh great Potentate!” Jakob called.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
         
Luuk placed atop Andy’s head a “crown of stone” (styrofoam balls painted grey). “Lead us, oh great Potentate!” Luuk said.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
         
So Andrew led them back to Hector’s house.
