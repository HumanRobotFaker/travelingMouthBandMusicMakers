&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Once upon a time, Malcolm was their friend.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    His name was originally Jeremiah Yoder, but he called himself Malcolm when they found him at the Dayton Metropolitan Bibliotech, still wearing traditional Ammonite garb, smelling like [faeces] from sleeping on benches downtown.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector viewed meeting him as "a sign". Hector was a delusional religious fanatic who judged himself to be the final amalgamation of yeshiThemself™, arising out of the terra to bring about the ultimate utopia like some crackpot video game protagonist that he button-smashed to victory in his prepubescence. 
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector -- in league with his DoctorDalton-funded lucid dream counsellor -- had come to understand that he was forming a decemvirate, with himself as the zero and the others as the other nine arabic numerals. He was searching for the others. And something sang inside him that this mysterious stench-ridden black-skinned Ammonite might be one.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "Hello," Hector said. "Are you reading the Divine Anthology?"
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Malcolm looked up. "Yes," he said in stilted anglo. "Specifically, the parts my peoples don't read."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "Your peoples meaning the Ammonites?"
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Malcolm nodded.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "And there are parts y'all don't read?"
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Malcolm opened his mouth as if to speak, but then closed it. He reached for the chained ink pen and notepad that the biblio provided to all desks.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    He drew ten squares and then circled all of them.

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "These ten squares are [like] the D.A.," Malcolm said. All the squares are in the circle, like all the books are in the DA. All the squares are in the circle, like all the words are in each particular story. Understand?"
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     
    "Yes."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "But the ways our eyeballs work, we cannot look at all ten squares at once. You <I>think</I> you can, but it is illusion. If you focus your gaze at one thing, you will realize that we see sharp only at one tiny pinpoint. The rest is a blur."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector tried this on a piece of text in Malcolm's DA. He found it to be true.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "So our eyes move back and forth, quickly, rapidly, non-smoothly," Malcolm said. "From one square to the next, until our [imagination] smooths it all together in one picture."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "Okay."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "You understand?"
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "Yes, but not how it relates to the Divine Anthology."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Malcolm smiled. "We Ammonites direct our eyes only to certain parts. And certain parts receive our attention more than others. So the <B>whole</B> Divine Anthology <I><U>is there</U></I>, but we don't read it equally."

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Emphasis,” Hector said.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
    Malcolm looked up quizzically.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
    “This,” Hector said, pointing at Malcolm’s diagram. 
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
    “Oh,” the Ammonite said, nodding his head. So I’m trying to pay attention to the non-<I><U>emphasis</U></I>. The barely circled squares.”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
    Hector nodded. Then he extended his hand. “Hector Chavez.”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
    Malcolm stared at Hector’s extended hand. He made no movement.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
    Hector returned his hand to his side. “And you are?”
