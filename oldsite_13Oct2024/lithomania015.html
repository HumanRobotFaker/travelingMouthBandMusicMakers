        Her journal was boring, but she did have some lurid details in it. She made Hector read it in the bedroom while she was around. She didn’t want to be near him when he read it, but she was afraid he would take a photo of the page with his MOB. 
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        After he read it, she asked: “So when am I reading your diary?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Hector didn’t have a diary, per say, but he clearly had a zillion spiral notebooks littering his bedroom. So he went home, ripped out all the journal-entries, and used a few paper¢lips to hold them all together.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        She sat on his bed while she read it. His bed being a sheeted mattress plopped on the floor and shoved against the corner. He decided to sit at his “office desk”, which was a folding chair against a folding table. He barely cleaned up, kicking all his clothes into the closet and stacking books in semi-tidy piles.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Woah,” she said. “You cheated on Britni three times?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Only at the end. Once I felt certain that she didn’t really like me; she just liked the idea of me. She simply preferred my presence over being alone. That I, in all honesty, was a bit of an embarrassing annoyance.”
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “But isn’t that just projection? I mean, right here you wrote that you crafted Britni into a yazata so you could feel good about yourself, only to detest her once she failed to live up to this artificial image you’d secretly created in your mind.”
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector shrugged his shoulders.
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Who were the girls? Did I know any of them?”
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector didn’t want to tell her. He was afraid she’d know some of them.
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Come on,” Khali said. “I thought we were the Total Trust Society. Don’t you trust me? I always ran the in-between you two, and I never betrayed you. And I never told Britni about Jessica, even tho’ she sort of knew.”
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            So Hector told Khali the names. And how each happened.
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Boiled meat,” Khali said. “You cheated on Britni with those girls?”
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector squirmed in embarrassment. “I just could tell they liked me. Or were attracted to me. Or would let me. So I did.”
            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Khali laughed. “What kind of yeshian[*] are you?”

        [*Khali is not a yeshian. Her family is Maniite.]</mark>
