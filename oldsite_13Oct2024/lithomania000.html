<p>            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You won’t believe this, but <mark class = "markred">Hector</mark> claimed that a quakershaker came into his dream and told him to dig a hole at  <mark class = "censored">[redacted]</mark>, where he could be expected to find «the ultimate meaning of existence».
            
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo Hector walked two subdivisions over to a subdivision that is permanently-in-progress, a brown dirt field hoisting up a half-dozen houses along a long stretch of a winding, black asphalt snake of a road, which was originally designed for five deka[-]domiciles (before the financial freeze collapsed the company building them). He approached a nondescript, slight elevation of dirt and double-checked the coordinates on his MOB. Then he drove a shovel blade into the terra.
