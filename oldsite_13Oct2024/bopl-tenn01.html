	At noon, the band played at a dive bar apparently populated with other bands (and their close friends and significant others). They covered their body with advertisements and logos, claiming that every song was sponsored by one or another fake products. The crowd was more invigorated and appreciative of the antics. They cheered and roared and played along with the shenanigans. After the show, the band had me sit behind the merch table, selling t-shirts and stickers.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Are y’all from Austin?” a person perusing the stickers asked.
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Yeah, the band’s from Austin.”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “You’re not ‘though? You’re not in the band?”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “No. I’m from Antarctica.”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Ohhh,” they sang. “I hear that’s pretty rough around this time of year. Permanent nighttime?”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Oh yeah,” I said. “Not for the faint of heart.” <BR><BR><BR>

	The second show was in a small parking lot, bordered in by many ropes holding colourful #6 plastic triangles. With my assistance, the band sold raffle tickets for nickels, dimes, random worthless objects, pocket lint, business cards, – and held a raffle throughout the show for items such as the lead guitarist’s pic, a band t-shirt, a lock of the rhythm guitarist’s pubic hair. Then the band ended their set by putting on flower costumes and throwing seeds at everybody, whilst singing a high-tempo tune about the wonders of reproduction. While everyone danced.
