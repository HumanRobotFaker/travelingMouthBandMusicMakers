         At some point, long ago, Principus Cox and his wife became devotees to the neo-yeshian spiritual practice known as “divine dream communication” [DDC]. The concept is simple: one should seek to <I>incessantly</I> commune with the great ground of being. 
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         To those of the traditional yeshian ilk, it wasn’t that far off from simply maintaining the “peak days” in the normative practice of attempting full silent sixty-second communion an increasing number of times a day throughout the moon cycle (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 18, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, and repeat). And while that alone seemed “extreme” to many normative yeshians, the DDC-crowd with whom the Coxes became entangled took it a step forward: incessant communion included the time humans were s’posedly unconscious. 
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
      “Think about the protagonists in the early era Divine Anthology [EEDA],” the presenter said long ago. “Most of them received communion not in their waking life, but in their <I>dreams</I>.”
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      So the Coxes began, in earnest, working toward the first step of DDC: remembering their dreams in the first place. They kept bedside spiral notebooks and awoke early to pen down their memories of what they’d just dreamed. At first, there was total honesty: as they developed greater and greater lucid recall of their dreams, they spoke enthusiastically about everything that happened in their dreams. But the practice of DDC leads to the perception of dreams increasing their longevity, which makes the day-to-day oral recall process more and more laborious. So the Coxes stopped discussing their dreams except in vague paraphrases. 
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      And then Principus Cox began <I>manipulating</I> his dreams.
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      DDC worried many yeshian leaders in the first place because it took the power out of the temple leaders’ hands, and placed individuals’ spiritual development into the realm of the irrational, hidden unconscious. But the process of <I>manipulating</I> your dreams was considered idolatry and dancing with the malevolent spirit that is Ahriman. 
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      “Why?” Principus Cox asked the stranger who brought it up at a conference.
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      The stranger laughed. “Because the normative crowd is spiritually <I>less developed</I>.”
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      “But what is the declared rationale?”
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      “Their argument is that individuals will become intoxicated with power and forget that the Almighty & Awesome Ahuramazda [AAA] is the creator and arbitrator of all things.”
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      “But why would <I>manipulating</I> your dreams cause one to forget?”
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      “Because. When you control your own dreams, <I>you can do <B> ANYTHING</B></I>. In the dreams, that is.”
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
      “Anything? But how?”
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
