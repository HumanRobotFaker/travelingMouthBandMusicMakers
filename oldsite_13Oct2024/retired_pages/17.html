                “I stole <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s printer,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What?” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I went to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s house, broke in, and stole his printer. And his binder of LucidDreamRecall that he T-T’ed to it. Then I took it home and set it on fire. The binder, that is.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Why would you do that?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> looked me straight in the eye. “Because he’s a chump. A narcissistic abuser. And if Ahuramazda put me on this terra for any reason, it’s probably to throw sticks into the spokes of bicycles pedaled by boys who deserve to meet some asphalt.”
                 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Wow.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh, go wow yourself.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                She threw a bouncy playground ball at me. I caught it.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “How is <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> a narcissistic abuser?” I asked. “I mean, I get the narcissist accusation, but abuser?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What he did to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span> was evil. You know what he did?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Cheat on her and then break up with her?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> laughed. “That would be [animal faeces] behaviour, but not abusive. First, he cheated on her, then he wrote a bunch of boo-hoo poetry about how guilty he felt and then <i>posted it</i> on his publik infinityspace™ site. <i>Then</i> he would talk to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span> as if everything was totally normal even ‘though he <i>knew</i> she read all his poetry. He made <i>her</i> bring it up. And then he lied and said it was <i>metaphorical and hyperbolical</i>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Then she stopped talking.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So, when do we get to the part about <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> physically battering her, calling her a fat cow, and raping her?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You unimaginative hypointel,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “Don’t you know psychological torture is worse than than physical torture? The ramifications are much longer lasting.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Is that so?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yes.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “How do you know?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “My family line involves some extensive torture. Some on the being tortured side of things, but usually on the torturer side of things.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “How am I not surprised?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Your dad kidnapped his skoolteacher when he was young,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “What do you think was worse for the teacher: being physically assaulted by his students or the fear and uncertainty of knowing what would become of him?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I see where you’re coming from,” I said, “but I feel like it’s a reach to connect <i>this</i> to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s teenage behaviour in his first serious romantic relationship.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It wasn’t his <i>first</i> and it’s a pattern of events, if you care to channel the data trail. I know you’re a <i>minimalist</i> when it comes to actually utilizing that revolutionary technology on your corneas, but if you actually <i>searched</i>, you’d see that <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> is a misogynist in behaviour and affect. And yes, you can boo-hoo about it being genetically derived from his dead father or it being behaviourally learned from interactions with his mentally disturbed mother and pseudo-father figure in his big brother, but the tangible reality is that he’s a misogynist abuser who is attempting to fashion himself into some strange LucidDream CultFigure and I feel duty-bound to obstruct such a development.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I nodded, T-T’ed a question to [an app], and received a response at the speed of [an electromagnetic field disturbance]. “Plus, it doesn’t hurt that the AAAs indicate you’ll receive an uptick in social point rankings for such efforts.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Happy coincidence.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Indeed,” and then in the corner of my eye, I see <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> approaching on bicycle. “Here comes our team.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                And then from another direction, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> rode in on his bicycle. He arrived first.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Hey <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “I thought you were bringing <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> everywhere these days?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “She had a gynecological appointment,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said without a hint of a chuckle. Then he leaned his bike against a tetherball pole and locked his bike. “Have you finally finished molesting <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span> here? He’s a pretty compliant soul; you probably don’t have to do quite as much grooming as you’re doing. You can just tell him what to do”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Another sex-obsessed boy,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “Surprise; surprise.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> arrived. “Hello,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> sang, as they dismounted and step-pushed their kickstands into position. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> removed her backpack, unzipped it, and began distributing origami paper cranes to everyone.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What’s this?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Just a present,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> said. Then she reached into her backpack again. “Also, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> made these:” and she handed out small laminated cards. They read: <i>Why do we skool children to live in a free, cap’listik democr’cy by subjecting them to rules upon which they cannot vote? By not giving them a free market of ideas?</i> On the back side, it commanded us to join Students for a Free Cap’listik Democr’cy.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Umm,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, “the answer to this question is pretty obvious: we <i>don’t</i> live in a free, cap’listik democr’cy.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well, no duh,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “We live in a pseudo-democr’cy,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> continued, “that is actually a republik governed by oligarchical interests, who, <i>amongst themselves</i>, have a free market of ideas. Although, that last part is debatable.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> waved a hand in dismissal. “Thank you, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>, but that is immaterial to the cause at hand. These here federated states have the mythos associated with freed’m, democr’cy, and cap’lism and thus we are leveraging the discord of those principles against the day-to-day realities of skoolchildren.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “As someone who goes to real skool,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, “do you <i>really</i> think it’d be better if your peers were granted the capability to autonomously run the skool through mob-majority rule?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> looked at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span>. “I thought this guy was supposed to be leading this anti-monarchy Penguin Liberation Front?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> shrugged. “He just likes to hear himself talk.” Then she T-T’ed me and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> a GIF of <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>’s AAA ratings dropping due to his lack of roleplay-consistency.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I’m just asking questions,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. And then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> T-T’ed back a GIF of AAAs being imaged as a part of metal shackles that chain humans to cinderblock walls.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> said. “I think skool would be better if we just expelled half the students who can’t hack it and send them to trade skools. But to make that <i>happen</i>, we need to create a chemical reaction which requires adding activation energy to increase collisions to break apart the pre-existing compounds and molecules.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> rubbed his hands together. “Oooh, I love me a good chemical reaction metaphor.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> snatched the bouncy playground ball from me. “Are y’all ready to play 4-square? Because I’m ready to set up rule in the A-spot.” And then she gave me prolonged eye contact with a smile as if I was a co-conspirator.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yeah, we’re ready,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “But since I brought the ball, I start in ‘A’.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Okay, what’s your rules?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Underhand only,” and then she served it by bouncing it once and swatting it into the ‘C’ square where nobody was. “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>, you’re out.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<i>What?</i>” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “The other squares are filled by order of arrival. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span> started in ‘B’, you were in ‘C’, and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> or <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Marissa</span> was in ‘D’.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> T-T'd an eye-roll.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
