        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Brazil awoke with the vague sense that he’d been dreaming, but all forms were blurry and indistinct even in color gradient. Sounds and smells were chaotic, unrecognizable, and emerged without warning before dissipating as if they never existed. He blinked his eyes numerous times and then sensed where he was: an emergency room. He could hear voices talking behind curtains. His veins were hooked up to tubes connected to bags connected to machines. For a long while, he didn’t move anything except his eyes. Then he wiggled his fingers. They wiggled. He wasn’t paralyzed.
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Eventually, after an indeterminate amount of time, the curtain pulled back and a nurse entered. 
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “You’re awake?”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Brazil nodded.
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “And it looks like you can move. You can wiggle your toys and your fingers?”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Brazil wiggled his toes and fingers. 
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Well, <i>in that regard</i>, you’re lucky. But the police had your blood drawn. I’m imagining you were messed up on something?”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Brazil tried to give a look of bewilderment. 
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Well, they’ll know soon enough.” The nurse looked at the machines and wrote atop a clipboard. “Furthermore, I should probably warn you – although you don’t deserve it – that your wife has been here and she has a hold of your [MOB]. And it seems like you’ve been harboring some secrets that she is plenty upset about.” And then the nurse was gone.
