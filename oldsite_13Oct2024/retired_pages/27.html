                The unnamed Ammonite had a name and it was <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span>. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> invited me to meet him, stating that he and I were “neighbours” because he lived five miles away, up a rural road to a dead-end dirt road.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I heard you met him at the Dayton Library,” I thought-text’d. “What were you doing downtown?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I’m sorry,” she t-t’d back, “but you do not possess that magnitude of security clearance in the Antarctic gov’t.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh, I don’t?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Apparently, you’ve been fraternizing with potentially hostile actors.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I’d spent the night at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span>’s, so I had <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> throw my bicycle into the back of his pickup truck so he could drop me off at the bike path. Once there, I bicycled lazily toward Xenia, giving <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> a chance to catch up to me from BeaverCreek.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Hey there, eunuch,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said, as the sound of her wheels approached.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Hey there, secret admirer,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                We pedaled eastward on the former train tracks as streaks of sunshine slipped through the leafy canopy that hung above our heads. I made the conscious decision to look at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span>’s butt, even/especially if some algos noted – an off-the-record suggestion of <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span>’s. I knew I should feel something, but I felt nothing. What a strange thing for humans to be drawn to: the flesh end where the lower appendages meet the axial skeleton, a bring-with-you-cushion of fat and muscle that we used to sit, an outer covering of the excreting orifice, a reminder for me that humans are just very complicated, selectively permeable, tubes.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> t-t’d: “You freak. I bet you like seeing the hair on the small of my back too.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I decided to [temporarily block] her thought-texts[.] “How much do you know about Ammonites?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Ummm…” she said. “They’re sorta like vegans who won’t eat grilled vegetables off a grill that’s [previously] been used for beef.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>, I mean, <i>Commie John</i> said that they’re unideal yet important example of decentralized, self-providing, small communities.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Why are they unideal?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You mean, beyond the patriarchal domination of women, the suppression of external information, and the promoted ostracization of all who leave the in-group?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Sounds like somebody knows a bit about Ammonites,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said, as sweat glistened down her neck. “But I disagree about the self-providing aspect. No community [(except autochthon hunter-gatherers)] are self-providing; no [hu]man is an island upon themself; the Ammonites intermingle with us normies, allow us to buy their products, and use ordinary federal currency credits.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Some of them,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<i>Most</i> of them,” she said. “But you’re right: the Ammonites are not some monolithic entity. Each little unit of forty families is a sovereign gov’t on their own. Which is why you see the variance in the utilization of technology and allowances for luxury.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                We turned off the bike path and down the rural road that led to my Ammonite “neighbour.” I wasn’t a big fan of traveling down roads where automobiles can travel 25 meters per second, delivering 600 kilojoules of kinetic energy upon impact. But the social pressure of following [combined with the algos’ suggestion] compelled me to pedal onward, hugging the margin of the asphalt.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Eventually, we arrived on the dirt road, which felt like it traveled another kilometer until we got to a small shack of a house, obviously self-made out of shipping pallets stolen from alleyways and trees cut down on the property.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                There was the unnamed Ammonite, a.k.a. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span>, kneeling in a small enclosed garden, grabbing pollen from a flower with his fingertips and smearing it onto the pistils of a nearby flower. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Hello <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> called. “This is your neighbour, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span> stood up and brushed the soil off his knees, as he traversed to the fenced edge of the garden. He held out a yellow-stained hand. “Hullo, Neighbour.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Hello,” I said, shaking his hand.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I am <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span>,” he said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I am <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Great to meet you,” he said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Great to meet you,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span> stood there in silence.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “How long have you lived here?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                He looked at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span>.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “That’s about the extent of his Anglo,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> laughed.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Isn’t there a translator app we can use?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Hey vol’ignoramous, use your iContacts™ and you’d realize that all the little Ammonite subsects have different languages. They can barely speak with one another.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “How does that make any sense?” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “They’re <i>anarchists</i>, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>. They hate centralization of power. Hard to conspire and plot when you don’t speak the same language.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I don’t think that’s the <i>correct use</i> of [the word] ‘anarchist’.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “There is no correct use of that word,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “That’s the whole point.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I shrugged my shoulders and stared at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span>, who stared back at me. “I have a question: why is <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span> <i>black?</i>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Because his genetic ancestors hailed from the equatorial zone and such epidermal pigmentation is helpful in garnering survival and successful reproduction.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I sighed. “All the Ammonites are blancos?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well, he was obviously adopted.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Or his parents were?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “He was,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “I asked him already. He knows his colors in Anglo.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span> pointed at the living structure behind him. “You want to see?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yes,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “We want to see.”
                <p><CENTER><img src="images/Jeremiah-House.jpg"> </CENTER>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                We followed <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span> around the garden and over to the ramshackle of a house. Door had modern hinges, but everything else looked like it was held together with hot glue and fishing wire. This was not the well-built barn shown on the cover of the eastOIHO tourism brochures. The ceiling was low, the natural illumination was scant, but the floor seemed like new vinyl faux-hardwood, perfectly flat, and well-swept. Then I saw why: they had a small little vacuum robot whirring around.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I pointed to the robot. “Technology?” I asked <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span>.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                He looked me in the eye. “No women.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                My incredulous face looked at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span>, who rolled her eyes.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The house was simple with no ornamentation. Beds were lifted off the floor, but the padding was minimal. There were a couple electrical plugs, a couple lamps, and that was it.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Outhouses?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span> didn’t know the word.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> pretended to sit down and pantomimed with her hand that she was defecating.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span> laughed and led us out the back. And there, up against the treeline, was a small wooden outhouse. He walked us to the side of the outhouse and showed us a line of narrow holes that had been created at some point and filled with soil. Apparently they just slid the outhouse over as they filled the hole with [faeces].
                <p><CENTER><img src="images/Jeremiah-Outhouse.png"> </CENTER>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Then we heard footsteps. An older blanco man approached.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span>,” the man said. Then he muttered some gibberish that was probably <i>words</i> in their old community’s vernacular [language].
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Then he looked at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> and me. “I told <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span>: if I wanted to have whole gangs of kids running around my property all the time, I’d’ve stayed in Charm [OIHO].”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh,” I said. “Do you want us to leave?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Nah,” and then he threw a dismissive hand and proceeded to enter the ramshackle house.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “That’s <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">Jeremiah</span>’s uncle,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. And then my AAAs demanded I interview him.
