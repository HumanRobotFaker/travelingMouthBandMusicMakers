                In the morning, Dad was in the living room, his face pissing out an incessant trail of smoke while he stared at the dark LCDTV screen solely illuminated with grey numbers and letters. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “‘morning, Dad,” I said. “What you programming today?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Just moving the monies around to each little sector and subsector.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I know what you should do,” I said. “Divert some of those monies to the subsector that is one, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander Xu</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                But Dad didn’t say anything. He merely cursed at the screen, his fingertips clampering all over the keyboard. He took his cigarette out of his mouth and smashed it into the oversized ashtray, temporarily depriving the paper cylinder of oxygen and ceasing the chained flow of exothermic reactions serving as its neighbour’s activation energy. Then he looked at me. “What’d you say?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I said you should divert some of those monies into a file-folder-directory labeled <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">XianderXu</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                He grinned. “Son, I wish. We’d live in the mansion for at least a few weeks before the feds and the ears came to take me away. Luckily you got that commission plan in that ponzi scheme of a skool you ‘attend’. What is it? You do your work and they give you 12packs of pepsiCoke?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Dad, yesterday they [NyleDroned] me a processing chip so I could solder together a circuit board.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “For what purpose?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “To program an animatronic penguin to sing patriotic songs about the divine right of neo-fascist monarchs,” I said. “And parrot party-line slogans.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                He pulled out another combustion-cigarette. “That’s pretty good. That’s better than pepsiCoke.” He added activation energy to the far end of the filterless cigarette and used his inhalation to pull oxygen through the combustion reaction, strengthening the exothermic effect. He exhaled the smoky byproduct. “So’ve you figured out how to game the system?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “What?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                He took a clean breath. “Have you figured out how to game the system? The algorithm that evaluates your work and spits out social points that you redeem for prizes. Do you know how to exploit it for maximum benefit?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Dad, I’m not interested in that.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Someone in your circle of peers is. Every system has a loophole to exploit against the intended wishes of the programmer themself.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Dad, I’m not trying to get expelled.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Of course not. We wouldn’t want to waste all that tuition monies we poured into the skool.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Dad, it’s publicly funded. It’s a charter skool.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Exactly.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Dad, I’m highly-ranked just doing whatever we feel like doing. It’s not complicated:-- you construct a narrative, you conglomerate a bunch of people to perpetuate it, and you construct an infinite number of high-quality eduProjekts and attach them to it.” 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “And you wear your iContacts™ as much as possible so the skool can datamine you and sell the data to interested speculators.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Well, that goes without saying.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I figured out how to game the social point system,” Dad said. “If you’re interested.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “The algorithm probably already screens for whatever scheme you’ve thought up.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “And maybe it hasn’t. The prizes and points you receive are based on a proportion system. You get prizes based on the value of your points, which’re weighted based on the number of points total divided by the number of students enrolled and fostering taxmonies-allocated.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Real sleuth work there,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                My dad inhaled and exhaled a cloud of smoke. “So either you artfully-artificially deflate the points of others or you artfully-artificially inflate the points of your own. I suggest the former.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Dad, I’m sure the algorithm already stops such simple-minded shenanigans.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “And maybe it doesn’t. What does the company executive director care as long as the monies are rolling in to pay for their bloated salaries? They’re a non-profit. They <i>have</i> to spend the monies every fiscal skoolyear.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I don’t want to hear any more,” I said. “The whole concept sounds stressful and boring and I’d rather just do what I’m already doing.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Fine,” he said. “But don’t be surprised when someone does it to you before you do it to them.”
