            Deep in his dreams, Principus [Harja] Cox became a different man. In his waking life, Principus Cox began developing the regular habit of checking whether or not he was dreaming. He’d double-check written language in all its form, looking away and looking back, over and over again, just to see if the letters that comprised the words would start dancing, dissolving, pulsating, or descending into chaotic gibberish. He unnecessarily flipped light switches on and off; he rubbed his hands together to see if he could feel the heat from the friction. Eventually, it began bleeding over. In his now nightly marathon-length dreams, he’d suddenly remember to check whether or not he was dreaming. 
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         And then he would find he was.
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         In his waking life, he began shoving on walls, seeing if his hand would magickally pass through.
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         Sometimes it would.
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         Once he began realizing he was dreaming whilst he was dreaming, Cox would grow excited. Too excited. He wanted to do everything at once. His desire wasn’t to commune with the great ground of being that is the godhead Ahuramazda. His desire was to start running sideways along the walls of the room before leaping out a window and flying across the sky.
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         Principus Cox would grow excited. Too excited.
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         He’d wake up. It kept happening: he’d successfully realize he was dreaming whilst dreaming, and then his emotions would swell up in ecstasy and it would catapult him back into the waking world.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         This happened. It wasn’t a unique situation. So he [researched] techniques for dealing with «over-excitement», and began practicing breathing techniques in hopes that they would carry over. 
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         A few nights later, he realized he was dreaming whilst dreaming. 
         <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            He immediately sat on the floor, took a deep breath, and then breathed out a cool, calming, visible cloud of [cobalt blue]. He fused his emotions with the hue of blue and became a calm center. Then he stood up. And with a single impulse of his mind, he caused all the walls to fall down like a flimsy setting in a cheap movie.
