   "Whaddya think happens after we die?" Khali's older brother (Keivan) asked me after cornering me in a guest bedroom at Auntie's house. "You don't believe in that Vahalla+Kur [faeces], do you?"
   <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I don't know," I said. "As far as I know, I've never been dead."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Yeah, but <I>whaddya <B>think</B>?</I>" he said, sitting on the bed.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I...don't...know."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "I think we're just dirt. They put us in the ground and the bugs eat us, the animalcules eat us, and then we're dirt. And that's it."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "You sound very confident of that," I said.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "You think different? You think our magick lil' atman-spook flies off to another realm for which there is absolutely no credible evidence?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I was just commenting on your assuredness."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "No other theory makes any sense whatsoever."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        I continued standing. "Oh yes. Nothing incredible about the fact that substances mixing around on a giant rock conjure up all these crazy creatures who arguably possess various degress of consciousness. Nothing weird about that."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Consciousness isn't real."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Okay."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Free will is an illusion."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Got it. We're all just variables being defined by the values with which we're surrounded. Our actions are merely physical, forced reactions akin to a complex series of magnetic attractions and/or repulsions. The omni-denial of 'sponsibility."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "You're correlating to negatively connotate whilst conflating causation," he said.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "No, I'm just completing your train of thought."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Oh, you're a mind-reader?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Yes," I said. "And sadly, I know this is all a lure. «Oh, hey, morality is meaningless, so why don't you succumb to my twisted, depraved incestuous phantasies.»"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Keivan gaspedd in horr'r and disgust. "Magnificent 'mazda," he cursed.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Oh, you can deny it all you want," I said. "Even if I'd iContact™ channeled all of this, I'm sure your college girlfriend would believe you too. It's all very <I>subtle</I> and full of plausible deniability. But you know <I>and I know</I> what this was all about :- cornering me into a secret room for two while Khali's out shopping with your parents--" and he stood up and left the room in faux outrage (but in <I>real</I> embarrassment and shame of being called out). And on some level, I know it's not his fault :- this biological inheritance of a reproductive system ceaselessly creating a preposterous plethora of gametes, this caveman brain with zero chance of <I>him</I> being hobbled with pregnancy, but I'm just sick of it. I'm sick of it. I just want to be left alone. I want men to <I>ignore</I> me in that way so I can go about my business. And meanwhile, other women eat bottles of pills because they <I>don't</I> get that attention. And meanwhile, my uncle's dead in a freezer, waiting for the final ceremony at the funeral home.
