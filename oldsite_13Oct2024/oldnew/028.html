   A first, they radiate radio waves at the body. Obviously, one wouldn't be able to detect such a phenomenon, but they set a radio receiver there the convert the e-m waves into a squawking audio disturbance. You're s'posed to focus on the sounds, pay as close attention as possible, be one with the movement as it is s'posed to be the [derivative of the] foundation from which we all come and to which we all return. I focus and stare at my uncle's clothed corpse. The pitch increases higher and higher, until it hurts our ears. Then the [temple leader] steps forwards and lowers the amplitude knob until we're surrendered to silence. 
   <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Tears wet my cheeks.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Theoretically, the microwave range could also be transfigured into audio, but most Maniites choose not to. They prefer the juxtaposition of steadily increasing intensity and sudden silence, as your damaged ears continue to ring a steady oscillation. Some people prefer ear plugs. My father does; my mother and I don't. My little brother isn't old enough to attend.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    I look at my cousin Kevian, who stares blankly ahead, so assured that our uncle's personality is utterly obliterated, permanently extinguished. I look at Khali, standing beside him, wondering where her headspace is. Thinking how it's pointless to tell her how her brother is a creep. How all men are creeps.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    I look at my uncle. Was he a creep? I mean, I barely knew him. He acted nice to me and never mistreated me. But who knows what he did behind closed doors?
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Not me.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    The [temple leader] rings a bell. Wavelengths are decreasing and energy is increasing. You begin to feel it in the air, the gaseous molecules in the air increasing in speed, heating up the room. My aunt, the widow, emits an audible sob. My mother interweaves her fingers with her and holds her hands. The heat grows more and more intense. The room slowly begins to glow red like the coils of a toaster oven. 
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "He was a good man," my aunt says.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "He was a good man," we all echo.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "He was a good husband," my aunt says.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "He was a good husband," we all echo.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    My aunt stops talking and we wait. The red hues are gradually becoming more and more ornj as the wavelengths shorten. Ornj becomes yellow and yellow becomes green.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    "Oh <I>Zoro</I>," my aunt sings. "Zoro, my beloved, how we will miss you. It ears my atman to have you ripped from my breast so soon, too soon. Ahuramazda, I will never understand. I will never..." and then she turns into my mother, collapsing into tears.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Green becomes blue and it's almost over. The colours will transition to violet and beyond, making the rest of the ritual too dangerous for us mere mortals. In the old days, the wife might climb onto the deceased and ride off too, but instead, my aunt kisses my dead uncle's forehead as the lights become a deep violet. Then [they] slide his body through the opening, into the next room, where the UV rays, then the X rays, and finally the gamma rays will disintegrate him in totality.
