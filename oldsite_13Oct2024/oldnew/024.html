           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Jake Rums AKA «Commie John» declared that the abolition of gender was a progressive step in humanity's evolution toward a classless society. "We shall all be workers™ together! Undivided by the arbitrary divisions caused by noun modifiers, such as gender! Not male workers! Not female workers! Not cisgender workers! Just <I>workers™</I>!"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Are we gonna abolish variant levels of testosterone and estrogen too?" Winfield asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Ha, ha, ha, you guys," I said. "Next you'll tell me that you identify as a refrigerator, and then <I>I'll say</I> that the last time I heard that joke, I fell off my dinosaur."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "But I'm serious," Andrew said. "I identify as a carnate form of electromagnetic radiation-altered assembly of quarks and electrons, bestowed upon by Ahuramazda Themself."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Jakob turned to me. "And I'm serious. Moreover, I believe sexual relations should be abolished altogether, as they create a duprass allegiance of two (or three or four) whose means-and-ends likely will come into the conflict with the means-and-ends of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Hear! Here!" Andrew Ramblehurst said, banging his staff against the floor, as he donned EcoFreak Eddy's burlap sack. "Overpopulation is Enemy #1! Belabored Breeding in TestTube-only DNA recombination from this point forward!"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Have we started making CRISPR babies yet?" Winfield asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Jakob turned to me. "What're your pronouns again?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "They're fukk off and freeze in Kur," I said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Oooh," Jakob said. "<I>Feisty!</I>"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Which obviously is a mysogynistic microaggression. But I just rolled my eyes.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Mars went on a date," Winfield announced, "with this Påola character who went by <I>no pronouns</I>. Because apparently any pronouns is inherently dehumanizing and objectifying."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Andrew nodded. "Makes sense to me," he said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Jakob turned. "But what about common nouns? I mean, wouldn't calling this Påola a 'character' be reducing <I>Påola</I> to something less than?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Andrew raised his staff. "This is <I>why</I> we are humanity are going <span class = "emphasis">FULL-CIRCLE</span> and turning toward a nonverbal, image-only, communicative society. Thought-text will transition to full-on <I> telepathy</I>, with interhuman exchange of shapes in motion without all the messiness of symbolic language."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            And this is when I decided to indulge in a nonverbal gesture with my hand. And I showed it to all the boys in the room.
