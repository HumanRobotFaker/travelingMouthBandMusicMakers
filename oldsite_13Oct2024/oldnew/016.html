            With the productivity points (PP) earned by the proRasslin' noise, many items and tools were purchased for utilization on other eduProjekts™ by the boys. When I went over to Uriah's mother's condo to swim, Uriah's latest little spoil-of-war was an anglotranslation of an ancient indoChina text that [my AAA indicated] spent a large proportion of its characters detailing the differences betwixt HighPeople and LowPeople. The latter of which were s'posedly best treated like low-sentient animals to lure with carrots and beat with sticks so as to best fulfill their «divine duty» in doing the bidding of their betters (TheHighPeople).
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Ah," I said. "Preparing for Slavery2.0?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            He lowered his book and lated at me through his tinted solglasses. "Just researching for a religious text we're preparing to justify the subjugation of the lowly penguin and its transformation into a cybernetic superiour species."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "You know, it'd make more sense if these penguins were doing something aquatic. That's where they actually thrive. Putting them in factories and ice mines when they lack opposable thumbs makes no sense." Then I took off my shirt and shorts, reveleaing my one-piece swimsuit. It was the most skin I'd ever shown to anyone outside my family. I feigned nonchalance.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "well," he said, pausing probably to dismiss perverse thoughts, "the absurdity is a facet of the humour, MarsBar."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I removed and cased my iContacts™, shoving them into one of my disrobed pockets whilst simultaneously becoming hyperaware that I didn't know how to turn my body to minimize <span class="censored">[censored]</span> I might be giving everyone. Without another word, I dove into the shallow pool and bristled at the sudden cold of total submersion.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Once I settled myself and breathed, I went into my manatee routine, where I swooshed down to the bottom of the pool and slowly pawed myself forward with my two hands as I held my breath as long as possible. I liked the deafening ambient noise of the underwater. The nigh oblivion. The way the light danced with the rippling waves of the water (if I chose to open my eyes and allowed the chlorinated water to burn me).
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            A few minutes later, when I transitioned to swimming normally, Uriah was still seated on the reclined deckchair, reading his book.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Have you ever heard the theory," I said, "that human beings developed our mostly hairless features because there was a bottleneck period of our evolutionary history where humanity had to spend most of its time in ponds or lakes to survive?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Is there any evidence that this happened?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Other than rational conjecture based upon extant features? Not that I know of."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Uriah set down his book, stood up, kicked off his sandals, and jumped in the pool with his long-sleeved solscreen shirt to protest his pasty blanco skin.
