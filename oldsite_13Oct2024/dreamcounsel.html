 Hi Hector. How can I help you?

    My dream receiver seems to be malfunctioning?

 Is there a specific time-stamp to which you’re referring?
    </p>

 In that area.

 Reviewing location now.

    >>>>>>> 
 What exactly do you suspect to be malfunctioning?
    </p>
 
 
    <P align="right"; style="color:skyblue">
 My geometric shape assessor is misperceiving personas. 
 <<<<<<<
    </p>
 
 
   <P align="left"; style="color:greenyellow">
    >>>>>>> 
 Geometric shape assessors do not make persona identifications.
    </p>
 
 
    <P align="right"; style="color:skyblue">
 I realize that. 
 <<<<<<<
    </p>
 
 
    <P align="right"; style="color:skyblue">
 But the geometric shape assessor and remodeler are crafting individuals that my <I>friends</I> recognize as <I>other friends</I>. And it’s embarrassing and infuriating, because <I>I know</I> that the individual in my dream was actually <I>a different friend</I>.

 I am sorry that you are experiencing such an unfortunate scenario. It must be very difficult for you.

    <P align="right"; style="color:skyblue">
 Will you please cut the [faeces] with the fake empathy nonsense?
 <<<<<<<

   <P align="left"; style="color:greenyellow">
    >>>>>>> 
 You view that as superfluous? Very well. I will be more direct.

    <P align="left"; style="color:greenyellow">
        >>>>>>> 
     We cannot control what personas your friends apply to the geometric shapes our system models in response to your brain waves. Based on your dream diary content, we know that you are aware that dream personas are very fluid and dynamic, often shifting from one that resembles one WakingLifePersona to one that resembles a <I>different</I> WakingLifePersona.    </p>
     
     
       <P align="left"; style="color:greenyellow">
        >>>>>>> Furthermore, while one might make judgments that a particular individual was present in their dream, there is no certainty that dream content aligns with those judgements, and dream personas rarely if ever replicate real life personas with perfect felicity. 
     Moreover, just as people misperceive and misremember stimuli in their waking life, it is equally possible that they can misperceive and misremember stimuli in their dreams.
        </p>
       <P align="left"; style="color:greenyellow">
        >>>>>>> 
     Nonetheless, if you still believe our systems have performed a grave error, I can document this conversation and send it to the investigation queue.
