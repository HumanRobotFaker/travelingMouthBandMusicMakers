    The Kingdom of Lithomania had been established in Hector’s backyard. An eyesore of a backyard, plagued with weeds and overgrown grass going to seed, had been supplanted by a maze of stone-bordered shrines to various stone deities.

        Andy, Jakob, and Luuk began partying with publikskool kids. It started with a simple invite to a bonfire, where the trio amused the normies by drinking their yeefass exclusively out of hollowed horns, whilst wearing their furs and beaverskin hats. The other boys kept making lewd comments about how “soft the beaver was”.  
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The next night, the bonfire went to another location. Similar shenanigans occurred. Andrew began telling tales about how his ancestors were originally from Antarctica, but back when Antarctica was part of Pangea and close to the equator.  He said that they worshiped a godd of destruction, and they began smashing random objects with a big rock by the firelight.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Jakob named the rock. The rock was Maza.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Throughout the night, they would call on Maza to do damage upon random objects. They’d bang that rock against chairs, glass bottles, cans, and other stones. The only rule was you had to hold onto Maza when you did the smashing, so you could be «one with the destruction». Throwing Maza was prohibited.
