    <h1>.006</h1>

<p> The next morning, <span class="redstart">.</span><span class="red hoverable" id="uriah">Uriah Bleu</span><span class="redend">.</span> woke up in his bed feeling terrible. He didn't understand how it could happen: yesterday, over at Hector's, he felt a deep connection to the meaning of existence, a sense of belonging to a metanarrative much larger than himself, and it felt so... nice. </p>

<p> But now, he did not feel so nice.</p>

<p> He did not have the will to leave his bed, so he didn't. He just laid there. </p>

<p>Eventually there was a knock at his door.</p>

<p> "Uriah," his mom said. "You have a visitor. A classmate."</p>

<p> "Okay," Uriah said.</p>

<p> "Are you decent in there?"</p>

<p> "Sure."</p>

<p>The door opened, and <span class="greenstart">.</span><span class="green hoverable" id="winfield">Winfield Jones</span><span class="greenend"></span> entered.</p>

<p>"Hey buddy, I noticed you haven't logged-on to your iContacts™," Winfield said. </p>

<p> "Yeah, I'm feeling pretty awful," Uriah said. </p>

<p> Uriah's mother closed the bedroom door.</p>

<h1>.007</h1>

<p> "Dude, what the kur," Winfield said.</p>

<p> "Huh?" Uriah asked.</p>

<p> "Our points are plumetting because you're just laying in bed."</p>

<p> "<I>Our</I> points? What're you talking about?"</p>

<p> "No man is an island," Winfield said. "Doesn't your Triple-A tell you anything? What model you got?" </p>

<p> "I'm not sure...</p>

<p> Winfield sighed loudly. "Come on, get up."</p>

<p> Uriah just laid there. "Everything just feels so <I>meaningless</I>."</p>

<p> Winfield laughed. "Well, no <span class ="censored">[faeces]</span>. That's why you do this," and then Winfield pulled out a small glass jar full of flower blossoms. </p>
