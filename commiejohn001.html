    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
        Commie John was born when <mark class="markred"><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id"> Jakob Rums</span></mark> bought an oversized red suit at the thrift store. It was for a character for Moon Championship Wrestling, the newest eduProjekt at Traveling Mouth Band University. It was right after the Triple A’s were invented, and suddenly we were all doin’ whatever they told us to do. For the Maximum Especial Points. Obey and you get the most points. Don’t obey and you obtain less points.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
            It was all voluntary, you see.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
            No one had to do anything they didn’t wanna.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
                The points wanted us to make Moon Championship Wrestling, an entertainment company intended to entertain cyborg penguin indentured servants, slaving away at some mine in south Euraziakka. But, you know, usually we performed from the moon mines on the far side. Tape delay.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
    <mark class="markorange"><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id"> Andrew Ramblehurst</span></mark> declared that he was the carte-blanche military leader for Antarctica’s <I>norteamericano</I> operations, immediately employing a full scale invasion of <mark class="markyellow"><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hectorhouse"> Hector Chavez’s residence</span></mark>. You see, the algos knew that Hector’s dad was never home, so it seemed to sense that would be the perfect physical location to forcibly redesign into a base of operations for the Antarctic Kingdom.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
                Andrew wore his skout vest, full bedizened with his badges, so we started pinning medallions and hot-gluing coins to his vest. Soon his vest sagged, as he carried around his bedizened awards and accolades.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
                “BeaverCreek is a battleground for the souls and minds,” el generalissimo announced, as he stood on the milkcrate podium he was always hauling around. “We mustn’t let the penguin population grow lackadaisical, gluttoned by their own materialism. Living in tiny houses crowded with tiny hats and tiny pieces of crayon drawings covering everything.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Commie John might be considered Antarctica’s natural enemy, considering the kingdom’s insistence on unbridled capitalism and no-holds barred intranational economic policy. But John believed in a «middle path», so he was willing to compromise and budge. Late at night, they would sit upstairs in Hector’s southwestern-most bedroom, smoking cigars and incense.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “The aliens are already here,” Andrew said. “The Yashawashi discovered their cybernetic photon of light, which communicated it all very clearly. The aliens are coming. They are turning us into high fructose corn syrup.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “What?” John asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “High fructose corn syrup. The highly processed kind.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “And when are they going to be here?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Andrew looked at his watch. 37 jaars.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Oh okay, so not for a while.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “The Ears That Hear (ETH) are already moving in motion. In preparation.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Commie John shrugged. "What does that mean?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Big things are bound to arise. To manifest."
