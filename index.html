                According to the Temple Leader, Ahuramazda is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving. But I didn't see why that must be so. Just because They created the universe? Why're those characteristic traits a prerequisite? After all, my parents created me and they are none of these things. All-knowing, all-loving, and all-powerful. Why can't the creator of the universe lack any (or all) of these attributes? These theoretical, hypothetical properties?</p>
