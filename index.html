                According to the Temple Leader, Ahuramazda is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving. But I didn't see why that must be so. Just because <i>They</i> created the universe? Why're those characteristic traits a prerequisite? After all, my parents created me and they are none of these things. All-knowing, all-loving, and all-powerful. Why can't the creator of the universe lack any (or all) of these attributes? These theoretical, hypothetical properties?</p>

                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So I asked Hector. 
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hector, while a yeshian and not a Maniite, was, nonetheless, the only similarly-aged person I knew who took their religion seriously (not <I>claim</I> to take seriously, but <i><u>act</u>ually</I> take seriously).</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "That's a reasonable question," he said.</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Is it?"</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Sure. I've been reconsidering the WatchMaker metaphor myself, personally. You know the one, right? That if you find a watch, it implies that there's a watchmaker; thus, if one finds a universe, it implies a universe-maker."</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "But does it imply that either the watch-maker or the universe-maker is all-loving, all-powerful, and all-knowing?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hector nodded. "Right! But even before that: maybe the watch is a weak analogy for the universe. Perhaps a stronger one is an oak tree. If you find an oak tree, there's not the implication that there's an oak tree maker."</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Sure," I said. "But it could imply someone chose to plant it there."</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Maybe, maybe. But maybe not. Maybe some dumbass squirrel just accidentally dropped an acorn after the mindless pressure-gradient force caused pollination to occur." </p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  I paused. "Hector," I said. "Are you becoming an athiest?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "I'm just talking. Everything out into the solshine as you Maniites say, am I right?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I sighed. "As some say."</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "But haven't you said that? Total Trust Society? Or am I hallucinating?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Right," I said. "You are correct. I said that."</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Then Hector waved his hands at all the trees surrounding us. "But do you <i>really</i>, I mean, <i><b>do you really</b></i> think that all of <u>THIS</u> could exist without Ahuramazda?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I looked around at the trees. The vines climbing the trees. The birds landing on tree limbs. Everything was pretty and incredibly complicated. Cellular respiration and mitochondria. Deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid magickally stringing together amino acids into proteins. But I struggled to see what purpose it all served. And I told Hector so.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Whelp," he said. "Just because we're too stupid to perceive it, doesn't mean there's no meaning or design. It's like looking at a complicated engineering diagram or a musical score drawn by a genius orchestral conductor. Just because we cannot make heads or tails of it, doesn't mean that it's just mindless chaos." And then Hector stood up off the bench and promenaded forward down the boarded path, traversing over the wetlands. I stood up and followed.</p>
