    <h1>.000</h1>

<p> In the beginning, there was nothing. Nada. Naught.</p>

<p> Now let me start: this story is true, albeit not true in our uniVerse. But, considering the unfounded - yet plausibly probable - axiom that we live in an infinitely large multiVerse, it seems to follow that this story will be true somewhere in the space-time continuum.</p>

<p> So, 3.2 kilojaars after yeshi boiled in the giant cauldron, there was a town in OIHO called BeaverCreek, whose concentration center was approximately sixteen klicks east of downtown Dayton. On 32 June 3223 PB, <span class ="red"> Hector Chavez</span> withdrew from the official rolls to purportedly «homeskool». </p>

<p> This was an untruth.
</p>

<p> In reality, Hector's family was following an illegal protocol established by an AMABALA-based company whose shell company, <span class="proper-noun">Traveling Mouth Band </span><span class="white-emphasis">(TMB)</span> University, which was legally contracted with the state of OIHO to provide «alternative educational services» <span class="white-emphasis">(AES)</span>. By plucking Hector from the homeSkool category (rather than the publikSkool category), they were able to maximize state-contributions to PerPupilSpending.
</p>

<p> Before this change, Hector's family was facing legal action for truancy, as Hector had begun a 'lucid dream regiment' <span class="white-emphasis">(LDR)</span> that led to an eccentric sleep-wake pattern in total incoherence with the regularly schedule day at the BeaverCreekConcentrationCenter. At TMB, this would not be a problem. </p>
  
<h2>.001</h2>
    <p><span class="orange">Uriah Bleu</span> was the AMABALA boy who told Hector about LDR and TMB. He and Hector met on the internet, participating in an online roleplaying competition within the millieu of a corrupt pro'rasslin company operating on a lunar colony, [MoonChampionshipWrestling <span class="white-emphasis">(MCW)</span>].
</p>

<p>Uriah Bleu controlled a 'rassler named «<span class="skyblue">Dead Man Douglas</span>».</p>

<p> Hector Chavez controlled a 'rassler named «<span class="skyblue">Psycho Bunny</span>».
</p>

<p> None of this really mattered, except that:</p>

   <ul>
        <li> Uriah had become a paid subscriber to the LucidSleepAcademy, <BR>a west-coast cult run by the notorious Dr. Dennis Dalton.    </li>
        <li> The man who ran MoonChampionshipWrestling was Uriah's «uncle», <BR>a drunken astronaut who was childhood friends with Uriah's dad. 
        </ul>

<P>And then one day, <span class="yellow">Astronaut Al</span>, the drunken astronaut, was given an absurd amount of monies to surrender the MCW projekt to TMB University.</P>
