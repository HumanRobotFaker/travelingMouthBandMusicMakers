        Local government officials announced yesterday that <mark class="markred"><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id"> _Uriah Bleu </span></mark>, the 15 jaar old student who was arrested at last MarsDay’s BeaverCreek skoolBoard meeting, has been simultaneously enrolled at both the BeaverCreek ConcentrationCenter <I>and</I> <mark><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hectorhouse">Traveling Mouth Band University</span></mark>, a charter skool run by a multinational corporation located in Ulaanbaatar AILOGNOM. The OIHO State Investigative Bureau (OSIB) has opened up a preliminary case to consider the possibility of pressing charges against <a href = "uriahletter01.html">the guardians of Uriah Bleu</a>, who often goes by the moniker “Commie John”.
        <p>
        Bleu came to nat’l attention last week when his limited liability media company broadcasted indelible revelations of sordid extramarital sexual activities amongst the lead principus and two assistant administrators within the confines of the BeaverCreek ConcentrationCenter. After a brief review to ensure that the presented evidence wasn’t, in fact, generated by artificial intelligence, the skoolBoard announced an emergency meeting for last MarsDay with the intent of hiring interim replacements for the suspended administrative team.
        <p>
        This meeting was interrupted by Bleu and a coalition of fifteen students, who broke decorum and chanted for officials to resist the replacement impulse in favour of the establishment of a sanctioned “total student democracy” to run the ConcentrationCenter. After a failure to cease-and-desist, students were physically removed from the gov’t site and arrests were made.
        <p>
        Following Bleu’s arrest, investigators found that per pupil spending was illicitly duplicated for him, with tax dollars going to fund his education at the BeaverCreek ConcentrationCenter and a state-sanctioned charter skool for gifted students that is headquartered in Ulaanbaatar AILOGNOM. Gov’t officials at the state education council refused to answer questions about the specific mechanisms that are designed to prevent double-distribution of per pupil expenditures, nor would they guesstimate the number of similar instances that may be happening concurrently in the state.
        <p>
      Uriah Bleu has been suspended from activities at both institutions of learning until further notice.
