	“You’re obsessed with Britni,” Mars said.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “You can’t be mad at me for my <I>dreams</I>,” Hector said.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “I’m not mad. I’m disappointed.”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “But it’s <I>not even <B>true</B></I>. The dream reader messed up.”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “So who’s s’posed to be in the car with you? Don’t even say it’s me.”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “It wasn’t you.”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “But it wasn’t Britni?”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “No. It was Lyn.”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “<I>Lyn?</I> Who the kur is <I>Lyn</I>?”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “A girl I fooled around with. She lives in Kettering.”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Fooled around with? Like recently?”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Ummm…”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “You <mark class="mark4">[redacted]</MARK>.”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Silence.
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “How do you even know her?”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “She’s a friend of a friend from temple.”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “What’s so special about her?”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Will you stop giving me the third degree? We’re not even dating.”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Thank ‘mazda. Because you clearly don’t value it. You just make out with whoever’s within arm’s reach.”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “I’m leaving.”
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Leaves.
