        ***************
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            When Omusupe entered the room, with this expression of enraged disbelief across her tear-streaked face, Brazil felt this terrible pressure come over his crown. He sought to sink into himself as much as possible, to flinch away from this source of hurt and pain that would certainly seek to flow into him. So he became a statue. He became a rock.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            She sat down next to him on the edge of his bed. She stared at him. Tears flowed off her eyes and down her cheeks. She wiped them with her fingers. She stared at him unbrokenly for a long time and then just shook her head.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Eres un maldito gilipollas,” she said.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Yo sé,” he said.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Tenemos una hija. Somos una familia.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Si, nosotros somos.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Omusupe shook her head. “¿Por qué? Por què, Brazil?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “No sé,” he said.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “No quiero estar tu esposa ya.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Brazil nodded.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “¿ No tienes nada que decir? ¿Nada?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Brazil didn’t know what to say. She would probably be happier without him. With a more traditional man, one who had a conscience and didn’t simply think that secretive actions occurred in a vacuum. One who believed that a wife deserves to be with someone who is nakedly honest, rather than a snake in the grass, incessantly sneaking around.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Estas cosas que hice, no son sobre ti.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Alguna vez pensaste en mí? ¿Cuándo estabas con otras mujeres?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Brazil didn’t know the right answer to this inquiry. He thought about her in the sense that he didn’t want to get caught. He didn’t want to hurt her feelings. He wanted to simply do what he did in the shadows and have the actions occur in a void, unaffecting her, unaffecting their baby, unaffecting his reputation, unaffecting anything but his experience of transient pleasure and the sense of being desired. And now, with his actions out of the shadow, because he’d crashed his car and failed to erase text messages because he was high in suhtawree and unconcerned about anything other than maintaining that <i>hum</i>, his wife, mother of his child, sat there torn apart in primal agony. And he couldn’t simply push the undo hotkey. She had to live with it and he had to live with it, his causing her this pain through his callous disregard for anything but his own transient desires.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “¡Hablar!” she said.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “No sé decir,” Brazil said. “Pensé en ti, en no dejar que te enteraras, en no lastimarte.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Omusupe cried. She cried loudly and tears watered her face.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            The curtain pulled back and a police officer emerged with a nurse. 
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Mr. Chavez, I’m with the Ojinaji County Sheriff's Department. Has anyone told you how you came to be here?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Brazil turned to the officer. “Umm, sort of. I know I was in a car crash.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Do you remember how the car crash happened?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “I don’t remember.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “You don’t remember?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “I don’t remember.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            The officer continued gazing at Brazil. “Around eleven, yesterday morning, one of my officers found your vehicle off the side of the road, clearly disabled from a car crash. There was no evidence of any other vehicle involved. Furthermore, we are unsure if there were any other <i>people</i> involved in the accident. Mr. Chavez, were you driving the vehicle at the time of the crash?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “I don’t recall,” Brazil said.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “You don’t recall?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “I don’t recall.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Why don’t you recall?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “I don’t recall.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            The police officer blinked. “Okay. Well, if you <i>do</i> recall, that might be helpful for your situation. As it stands now, we have bloodwork that indicates you were intoxicated on a number of psychoactive substances, including suhtawree or something chemically similar. Considering this vehicle is registered to your wife, it seems that you were more than likely the driver of the vehicle, which would leave you open to a whole host of legal penalties.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Brazil nodded. “Okay.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Okay what?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Okay. Thank you for that information.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Considering you have a family,” the police officer continued, “I recommend that you contact a lawyer and enroll yourself into a substance abuse rehabilitation center. In general, the gravity of the charges is [ameliorated] when individuals preemptively take those steps.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Okay. Thank you.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            The police officer nodded. “Considering your current medical state, our Lead Enforcement Officer has granted you a reprieve from being driven to the station, under the condition that you allow us to fingerprint you here. You are technically under arrest. Will you allow us to fingerprint you on the hospital bed and save you a drive to the station?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Brazil nodded. “Sure.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            The officer nodded. “The officer will be here shortly.”
