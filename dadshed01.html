                The shed is unlocked. The boxFan runs continuously, blowing a paper ‘zine that’s shoved up against the wall. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                You pick it up.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The title of the ‘zine reads <B>:: The <I><U>Real</U></I> Reason Dr. Dalton Stopped Dreaming ::</B>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                You open up the ‘zine and see it claiming yashakawshi horr’rists from Nippon poisoned the water table with man-made chemical substances that deabilitate many individuals’ ability to perform RapidEyeMovement during sleep. This apparently caused a crisis in confidence that led to the leader of the infamous sleep society to make a series of decisions that were not in his best interest. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The ‘zine goes on to claim that the yashkawasha were furious at Dr. Dalton for attempting to penetrate into the deepest realm of divine meaning. You close the ‘zine and use your iContacts™ to pull up information about this yaskawishi group. Apparently, they’re simply an ultra-rationalist group of non-hierarchists who have been maligned by conspiracy groups to be part of some bizarre conspiracy involving extraterrestrials, gene-editing horr’rist acts, and the installation of cybernetic machinery into various ant species. But, in all likelihood, they are simply a boring political/philosophy group.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                You toss the ‘zine back where you found it. The paper flutters with the breeze created by the electric boxFan.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                There’s a manilla folder on the bed. You pick that up and find looseleaf papers in there.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The first one is a letter of some sort. Typewritten.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                It reads:
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

                Ming,
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Thank you for visiting the farm. With practice, you’ll get the hang of the EPDs[ Exothermic Propulsion Devices]. After all, they give them to child soldiers for a reason (easy to master).
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I know you aren’t thrilled about yeshianism as a whole, but I appreciate your consideration of participating in aspects of the movement. You and I are both from nation-states where individual freedoms were curtailed in the s’posed interests of the CommonGood™. We know what a sham it is and we can’t allow such shenanigans to take root in our adopted homeland.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I have included a coupon for a couple free hours at Red’s Range in AlgonquianTown. Don’t be afraid to try anything you want. Small arms or long arms. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

                Behind that page, you find the coupon for Red’s Range.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Behind that page, you find something that looks like an essay that has been photocopied from a book. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                It reads:
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

                [...] the result. The syncretic attempts by their nature lead to the erasure of vital aspects that do a disservice to the inchoate faithful; thus, the tendency, when observed, should be denounced without hesitation.
                
                <h3>SHAMSHOUNIANISM:- A CONVENIENT RATIONALE FOR TURPITUDINOUS BEHAVIOUR 
                <BR> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>      by Shamahr Brathwaite</h3></i>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                When Yeshi’s sacred corpus was given to the terra, the world was forever changed. Decomposing creatures broke down the body, autotrophs pulled these molecules into their cellular structure, and heterotrophs ate and devoured and incorporated as they were (and are) wont. Slowly, but surely, Yeshi’s divinity came to permeate more and more of this terra which we call home. How much of the terra currently possesses that divinity is a matter of speculation, but it is without question that the world is not the same as it was before Yeshi. This, for any true Yeshian, goes without saying.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Thus, we must firstmost dispense with pleasantries that shamshounianism is merely an alternative form of yeshianism. It is not. It is an abhorrent rejection that Ahuramazda brought Yeshi onto terra for us to emulate; it puts forth the consideration that <i>Shamshoun</i>, a marginal character in one tale of innumerable tales told in the [10 000] page DivineAnthology, to be the focal point of mimicry. It is a preposterous proposition. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Shamshounianism, as it exists in its current format, derives from neo-colonial activities forty dekajaars ago, as a result of callous and careless attempts by various yeshian subsects to convert autochthons in residential skool environments. Autochthons, who were taught the languages of the colonizing forces and provided copies of the DivineAnthology in those particular vernaculars, in many instances were not given proper guidance by skool officials when interpreting the texts. It is this lackadaisical “pedagogy”, which is directly responsible for the atrocities that occured in [insert location] in 1701.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Without appropriate context, a highly intelligent autochthon female came to believe that her “captors in educational guise” intentionally emphasized Yeshi as part of a ruse to make the students “more placable and submissive”, whilst the neo-colonialist exhibiting behaviour that was “anything but” (quotes are derived from her final letters). The sense of hypocrisy undoubtedly directed the incensed teenager to the Shamshoun tale as the iron crystals in the beak of homing pigeon are drawn to the magnetic north pole. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The Shamshoum taie is attractive to those with xenophiliac predilections. It explicitly warns about entanglement with a foreign enemy; the protagonist’s strength is lost as a direct result of his limerent marriage to a foreign bride and his subsequent surrendering of vulnerability. How would one expect an eighteenth century autochthon to respond after reading such a tale, when their people had just been conquered and they themselves were in the process of being forcibly assimilated? When the protagonist of the tale shouts to Ahuramazda for permission to die with this enemy right before committing an <i>incredible</i> act of MassMurderSuicide?
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The excision of this tale has been seriously discussed by individuals who do not pay heed to warnings in the DivineAnthology for not a single scintilla to be removed. They ask for what purpose does this tale still serve? But such inquiries are fatuous; simply because we, encapsulated and imprisoned, in our own time frame, cannot fathom the rationale, we must shed the hubris to believe with certainty that we can foresee the utilitarianism in scripture for eons to come [...]  </B>

                You turn the page, but find nothing printed on the back. You rifle through the other pages to see if the essay is continued, but none of the pages directly connect.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                You set the manilla folder back onto the bed. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                You crawl onto the floor to peer underneath the bed. There you find a black box with a code lock. There are four wheels you can turn, each featuring the ten numerals present in modern mathematics. This means there are 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 (10<sup>4</sup>) possible combinations. You try a few random ones and ones that you might imagine your father would use, but nothing opens the box. You shove the box back underneath the bed.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                You realize you’ve been snooping for a while, so you leave the shed.
