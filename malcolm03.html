        <mark>Hector Chavez</mark>, with a ballpoint pen, drew constellations on <mark class="mark2">Mars Bellicose</mark>’s naked back, using an analogue astronomy book (borrowed from the bibliotech) for reference, as the two sat cross-legged on Hector’s bed, a barely sheeted mattress plopped on the floor and shoved against the corner. Hector was attempting to slowly seduce Mars, even though [she] had made clear that [she] was a lesbian. He ran his fingers underneath the hem of [her] sportsBra to pen a deepSky object, a faint galaxy cluster featuring approximately eight bazillion stars. 
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       
        “Do you s’pose that the axioms of the Triple-Ms are nefariously designed?” Hector asked. “Or is it simply chaotic incompetence?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       
        Mars inhaled slowly, trying to redirect their thoughts away from their being slowly undressed by Hector, who’d recently broken up with Britni Lynn. Trying to pay attention to the oscillating tension and relaxation of the diaphragm muscle, which inflated and deflated their lungs.  
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “I think occlusion and confusion is part of the design,” Mars responded. “When I was in normieSkool, I had a teacher who absolutely refused to explain his grading system. At one point, my parents threatened to call a council session with the princeps because they were afraid I would end up with a «B» in the class.“ 
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Hector laughed. “Valhalla forbid!”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Mars winced as Hector lifted up their bra even more. “The teacher eventually relented, but he explained to my parents why he was against the standard rubric of clearly communicated criteria. Essentially, he felt it caused students to be minimalistic in their efforts and solely act in a fashion to game the system.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “So the Mongolian Mystery Machines want us to flail inefficiently, guessing what gives us Especial Points?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “I mean, if anyone is going to game the system, it’d be TMB students.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Okay,” Hector said, lifting the ballpoint pen from Mars’ skin. “All done.” And then he kissed her back.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Mars turned around and glared at him. Then Mars slapped Hector hard across the face.
