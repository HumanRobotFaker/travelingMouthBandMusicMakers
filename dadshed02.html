                Father’s sleeping quarters was a makeshift bedroom in the backyard storage shed. He’d been sleeping there since last winter solstice, when my mother and him announced that they needed a little space. Why? They just did. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                Luckily for me, the curious biological offspring of theirs, <a href = "mom01.html">
                
                
                <mark class="mark3">Mother</mark></a> kept a hardback diary underneath her mattress that detailed my father’s trespasses :- he gave a not inconsiderable amount of ¢redos to internet strippers. Fair-skinned [blanco] ones, it was noted.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Every once in a while, I’d check to see updates.

           <li> My father never apologized.
            <li>My mother felt economically and legally trapped due to immigration regulations.
            <li>My father refused to discuss the matter.
            <li>My mother decided to redirect her focus toward me and her spiritual practices.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I’d noticed my mother’s increased attention. In general, my academic progress had been only cursorily noted, as both parents didn’t attend much skool growing up due to the revolution (amongst other factors). She began asking questions. These questions made clear to me that she had no idea how TMB operated.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Did you not read the literature when you enrolled me?” I asked.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            She looked down and then back up at me. “I did, but I didn’t really understand it at the time. And it’s been so long that it’s been wiped from my memory.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Well, you know I have coaches, right?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Coaches like teachers, yes.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “And you know that they’re not real human beings?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Her eyes opened wide. “<I>They’re AI?</I>”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I nodded. “The vast majority of publikSkool expenditures involve staff salaries and structural maintenance. Since TMB foregoes those aspects, they have a surplus of ¢redos to spend <I>elsewise</I>. So instead of giving us <I>letterGrades</I>, they distribute EspecialPoints, which we can then use to purchase <i>educational supplies</i>.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I then showed my mother a line-chart on my MOB of my ¢redosEarnings. Then I showed her a similar line-chart albeit the ¢redosEarnings were adjusted for inflation. 
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            She looked at them quizzically.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “So you’re doing good?” she asked. “Does this mean you’re doing good at skool?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I blinked. “I mean, I think so.” And then I showed her an portfolic inventory of all my contributions to various eduProjekts. She asked me to click on the hyperlinks, which opened up the stored files.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            After a few clicks, she looked at my face. “Are they all crayon drawings?” <BR><BR>
