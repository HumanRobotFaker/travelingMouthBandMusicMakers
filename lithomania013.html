        Andrew, apparently wasn’t that real bellipotentate, he explained. 
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “He lives in Antarctica,” Andy said, and he drew Antarctica’s coastline on the wall with a big black crayon.        
     <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Oh?” Jakob said.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

        “His true name is le roi,” he said en français. “But you can call him Leroy. King Leroy.”

                The regional bellipotentate began banging a bone on a drum at the bonfires. Since autumn depopulated the scene from the concentrationCenterKids, the balance of power began to get crazy. Everyone painted on their face like autochthons. 
                <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “This is so wrong,” <mark class = "markblue">Khali </mark> said with paint across her face.
                <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                Andy wore the fur coat across his chest, and the crown of stone across his brow (although it was just painted styrofoam [expanded polystyrene]). 
                <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Lithomaniacs!” Andy shouted above the drum beats. “Maza is angry with how little you’ve built. You must build more. You must never rest.”
                <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Never rest!” we shouted.
