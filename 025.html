           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Then my uncle died.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            It was my mom's sister's husband. Khali's dad's sister's husband. He smoked cigarettes, stressed at work, ate poorly, had a big ole gut, and one day he went outside to smoke and fell over dead.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Block the artery, the lil' highway-tunnel stops flowing blood under the high pressure &#8594 low pressure dictates, and oxygen cannot find its way to mitochronida, and no ATP gets made. Cue loss of consciousness. Cue death.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The morning before he died, I awoke from a dream I actually remembered. There was this swanky café near the [Dayton College] that Winfield took me to (although at some point, Winfield became Hector), and as I brushed past the wall, I saw this incredible wood engravement of Manii in the wall. I thought, «Woah, this is weird» because [Dayton College] is a yeshian university. Then, suddenly, the engravement moved and separated itself from the wall. Then Manii winked at me.
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Whaaaaa....!?!?" I said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Manii waved me along and I followed him down a dark hallway. We went down some steps, the flooring changed from hardwood to concrete, the walls became shower curtains, a musty, mildew drip could be heard as we rushed by a torrent of images: surgeons slicing open a patient laid out on a table, a homeless man smoking a cigarette with his back to the wall, two sexbots engaging in a simulated sexual encounter, and Manii ahead of me just barrelled forward, not even giving them a glance. We reached a dead end with a circular opening in the floor, down which Manii entered by climbing a ladder embedded into the substrate. I climbed down in pursuit, and when I reached the bottom, I found myself in a tiny room with ornate furniture and Manii behind a bar.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Whaddya want?" he said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Whaddya mean," I said. "«Whaddya want?»?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Whaddya want? To feel good about being rich? Righteous about being poor? Proud to be educated? Emboldened for being humble?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Manii swept his hand toward the tiny shelves behind him. Thousands of tiny cubbyholes hoisting up tiny glass jars, vials, and corked test tubes. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "We got it all," he said. "Whaddya want?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Whaddya got inside those tiny jars and vials?" I asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Everything," he repeated. "Absolutely everything."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            So I just said something. "Gender is an artificial construct."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Manii turned around, consulted a small scroll, and began pulling vials out of cubbyholes. He then turned around and set a fistfull on the bar. He uncorked the vessels and used tweezers to remove tiny scraps of ancient papers. It looked like the Vehicular Verses had been cut up with tiny scissors and compartmentalized in a nigh infinite array of jars. "Let's see... follow thy husband because - no - a women's wisdom is solshine through - no - ah, here it is. In the infinite eyes of Ahuramazda, we are one atman, unified and undivided." Then Manii set the scrap of script on a metal spoon, set it atop the flame of a candle, and the scrap liquified almost immediately. Then he used the pressure-gradient force to pull the liquid into a syringe, before asking for my arm. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Hector said to never say «no» to a dream character, so I laid out my arm with my forearm upward. He took a rope and wrapped it around my bicep, pulling it tight, and tying it. Blue veins emerged. Then Manii looked me in the eyes. "Just remember where you get the good stuff," he said, and then he stabbed the syringe right into my blue veins. A kaleidoscope of colours exploded in my field of vision and I was gone.
