           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Then my uncle died.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            It was my mom's sister's husband. Khali's dad's sister's husband. He smoked cigarettes, stressed at work, ate poorly, had a big ole gut, and one day he went outside to smoke and fell over dead.

            Block the artery, the lil' highway-tunnel stops flowing blood under the high pressure &#8594 low pressure dictates, and oxygen cannot find its way to mitochronida, and no ATP gets made. Cue loss of consciousness. Cue death.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The morning before he died, I awoke from a dream I actually remembered. There was this swanky café near the [University of Dayton] that Winfield took me to (although at some point, Winfield became Hector), and as I brushed past the wall, I saw this incredible wood engravement of Manii in the wall.
