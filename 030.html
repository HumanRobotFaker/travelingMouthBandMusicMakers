           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           I woke up and it was dusk. My back gleamed with sweat, soaking my shirt, as I watched the boxfan in the open window lifelessly drift its blades by the push of the wind. Hector’s house had no air conditioning and I was thankful for the shortness of my hair.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           I could hear a sound of activity. I stood up and glanced out the window, which faced the front of the house, but I saw nothing new out there. The neighbor across the street mowed their lawn. I tried to listen through the din of its noise. A few moments later, I heard it. Something.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           Silently opening Hector’s bedroom door, I popped my head out into the hallway. The noise came from a room deeper in the hall, one that used to be Hector’s older brother’s bedroom, but which now just stored random junk. I took a few, quick, silence steps atop the dingy carpet to better hear what it was. And then I heard a voice.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “You like that, huh? You dirty little agop,” he said. It sounded like Hector, so I listened closer. “You’re mine, tell me, you’re mine.” But it wasn’t Hector. That wasn’t Hector. That had to be Hector’s older brother Brazil. I listened for another voice, but I didn’t hear anything, anything other than the obvious sounds of him <span class="censored">[redacted]</span> , so I scurried down the hallway, silently closed Hector’s door, and sneaked down the stairway.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           I thought about outright fleeing, but curiosity got the best of me. No one was downstairs and nothing had changed. I found a book (“Hidden History of Shamshounian Horr’rism in these here Federated States”) and began reading it on the worn-and-torn pleather couch adorning the living room. I opened where it was earmarked. 
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            «Amongst the aforementioned incidents was an act of Shamshounian horr’rism that is very little known despite its scale. The reason behind its obscurity in the publick consciousness predominantly is the effect of its geolocation being largely isolated from the large populace centers of the federated states, where written records mainly manifested. Nonetheless, records exist :- in the [mid-nineteenth century], a group of students, autochthons involuntarily housed at a remote academic center managed by a yeshian subsect of the Europa Universal Bevy, rebelled against their captors/educators by murdering them in their sleep. The youths, to be precise, had been radicalized by a certain set of tales buried in the early era divine anthology, taking their teacher’s metersticks and fiddling their ends to a sharp point that they then drove into their sleeping breasts. The children, for months thereafter, ran a self-contained community, until hunger and starvation pushed most to flee the premises, wagering their luck in the wilderness. When marshals, hired by the EUB subsect, arrived half-a-jaar after the attacks, they found the population decimated and easily overcome with minimal effort.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           How did the youths become enamored by an obscure set of pages in the […]» Footsteps clamored down the stairs and I lowered the book. Hector’s big brother Brazil swung into the room and suddenly stopped. 
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “Ummm…” he said. “Who are you?”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “Mars Bellicose,” I said.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “Mars Bellicose?”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “I’m a friend of Hector’s.”
