 Sometimes the pain of being Ourselves™ is simply too much for us to bear. The mass wants to plummet toward the core of this terrestrial planet and we simply cannot muster up the Normal Force to prevent the downward acceleration. Sometimes we want to see Ourselves™ free-fall with nothing to counter our velocity except some scant air resistance. Until we hit the ground at the bottom of the crater. The crater might be a deep crater, but there is still a bottom.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 But let’s be clear, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> never intended to <I>die</I> from this downward spiral.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 After Britni walked out of the party and left in her silver car, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> became a cartoon character. Maybe he was always a cartoon character. But – it was clear to me – he most certainly was a cartoon character when he walked back into the house. He was an actor, playing a role. He grabbed a full can of yeast-water, ripped open the top, and released the high pressure gaseous particles to diffuse into the room atmosphere, before tipping that can upside down and gulping down all the liquid as it fell downward.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 Gulp, gulp, gulp.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 Just like a movie.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 He was the heart-broken protagonist. So utterly torn apart in agony that he no longer cared for his well-being. How romantic. How poetic. He would be half out of his mind, intoxicated, and up for any nonsense that anyone halfway-encouraged.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 ******************
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> Jones took him to Bernie’s Grocery Store. Purportedly, the rationale was they were going to lurk by the newly installed bar, spot some alcoholics who went to the <I>grocery store</I> to get crunked, and then spy on them for the rest of the night. But alas, nobody was actually seated at the bar, so they meandered throughout the store, loading up a shopping cart full of DietCitrusDrop™ two-liters, before <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> disappeared to go to the bathroom. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> checked out and wheeled the cart through the automatic doors, spilling out onto the black ocean parking lot, barely populated with automobiles.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> rolled the car up to Winfield’s parents’ golden car and waited. He tried to look up at the stellar pinpoints of light in the sky ( light which’d traveled top-speed for seven centuries to reach his pupils), but he couldn’t see anything due to the halogen lights hanging two dekameters in the air. So instead he looked down at the yellow lines cracking atop the black impervious cover. 
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “Oh!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, as he exited the store. “There you are!”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 He unpocketed his keys and the car’s trunk shot open. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> pulled the two-liters out of the car and began loading them into the trunk.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “I brought us a magic potion from the den of the dragon,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “Oh yeah?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> said. “What’s that?”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “I’ll show you in a moment.” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> helped load the trunk, and then he ceremoniously shoved the cart into the middle of an unpainted thru-lane. The two teenagers hopped into the vehicle, and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> drove off before the gasoline part of the engine had a chance to roar to life.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> unpocketed two, small, dark brown, opaque bottles and tossed ‘em at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>. 
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “What is <I>this</I>?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> asked, looking at the labelless, glass bottles. 
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “The half-digested blood of a vampire,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. “S’posed to make you disassociate and jettison yourself from the prison that is your skull. Make you float above yourself like an observer in a hot air balloon.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> twisted on the lid and found it to be one of those ChildProofMedicineCaps™. “So what do we do with this blood?”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “Open up your throat, plug your nose, and simply throw it down the hatch. Just try not to breathe. It was cut out of a vampire’s stomach after all. Foul-smelling stuff.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> hesitated. “Won’t that turn us into vampires?”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> shook his head. “Only <I>temporarily</I>.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “When do you want to drink it?”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “Now is fine with me.” Then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> reached blindly behind his seat to the floor of the car. His hand returned, armed with a can of Diet Citrus Drop. “Just immediately chase this potion from the underrealm with this stuff.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> hesitated. “Is this stuff safe?”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “Yes,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. “There’s only trouble when people drink the <I>wrong</I> half-digested blood for a surgically impaled vampire.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> shrugged his shoulders. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> ripped open the top of the soda can.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “You ready?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, as he drove the vehicle down the black river of a road. “Just remember not to try to taste this stuff. Don’t even <I>breathe</I>. Just open up your throat and pour it all down until it’s all out. Then swallow it with one gulp.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 So <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> removed the ChildProofSafetyCaps™ and passed <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> one of the tiny bottles. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> held the steering wheel with his thigh and clinked his tiny glass bottle with Hector’s.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “To the death of the ego!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. And then he poured the viscous liquid down his throat and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> followed suit. When the bottle was empty, both boys put it down and swallowed their throats.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 The taste was death.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
