           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Where you go to skool?" some hypointel asked me.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I'm homeskooled," I lied.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Homeskool's illegal," he said. "I'm reporting you."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Oh no," I said. "My parents are gonna get thrown in prison and they'll get gomohed."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Gomohed?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        All these hypointels have these fake yeshian parents who've never read them the Divine Anthology because they're functional illiterates. "It's in the first book of the DivineAnthology," I said. "Two of Ahuramazda's angels come to visit the land of the heathen, but as they're flying overhead, the savages shoot them down with arrows. Then they find the maimed angels and arse-raip+mouthfukk them to death."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        The hypointel looked at me. "Are you religious?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        His buddy proximus punched him in the shoulder. "Dude, she just said 'arse-raip+MouthFukk'; she's not religious."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Actually," I interjected. "I <I>am</I> religious. There's nowhere in that 10,000-page DivineAnthology that declares one cannot say potty words."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        The dude laughed. "I am pretty sure there is."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "You got a MOB," I said. "Tell me the book and stanzaNumber."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        The dude unpocketed his MOB and looked at it, but immediately was distracted by a popUpMessage indicating that he needed to watch another advertisement to get another five-minute RoxxxieVacuum™ session. I walked away.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Winfield opened another yeefass can, rippling a sonic wave from the liberation of carbon dioxide gas. "Sure you don't want a drink?" He took a sip. "It feels <I>pretty</I> good."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "You're disgusting." 
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "And I'll start looking pretty good. You already look pretty good."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Keep your depraved imaginings to yourself. Where's Hector?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Oh, you know, trying to discover the magickal combination of maneuvers and verbiage to incredibly illuminate the heathen minds of Ahuramazda's infinite grace, inspiring all to commune in an omni-loving, selfless, ever-sharing utopia. You know, something that's <I>never</I> happened."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "How did it end up when Yeshi tried that firsthand four thousand jaars ago?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "He got boiled alive in a giant cauldron and turned into yeshiStew™. But the plot twist is that -" and I walked away to the long dining room table, where Hector sat with a group of males, who all took turns laying down playing cards in accordance to a ultra-convoluted set of rules, all designed to compel the participants to binge-drink at a faster rate.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I'm leaving Hector," I said. "My parents called me a robo-uber."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        He stood up and gave me a hug. But he squeezed too tightly and smashed my tits into his chest. When he released, I saw some fat kid smirk.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        «Men are vile creatures enslaved by the hyperbolic populace of their gametic cells» a fictional character's voice echoed in my head.
