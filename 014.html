           Much of the boys' productivity points @ TMB came from this proRasslin' cos-play that Hector invented and abandoned after it became grossly successful. It was called Moon Championship Wrestling because - as the story goes - it origially started as a gov't-provided entertainment service for indentured servants working at moon mines, where they drilled for heavy hydrogen isotopes at the bottom of lunar craters. 
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           The work days were long, considering that the lunar day lasts 336 hours, and sometimes the workers just needed a lil' respite from the drugery. [To be clear :- there were no actual lunar colonies at the time.]
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           Well, this idea, as all «good» ideas do, permutated a zillion times until it was more focused on the concept of a proRasslin' league entertaining cyborg penguin guest workers (emigrated from Antarctica) than one attempting to entertain humans on other planets. The boys did everything a real proRasslin' company would do :- sold merchandise, wrote press releases, crafted hypercomplicated characters and storylines, «booked» venues in different cities... everything except the actual hosting of a live show where steroid-injecting muscled freaks performed acrobatic, high-athletic feats of fake, choreographed fighting that shortened their lifespans by an average of two decades. For <I>that</I>, they worked with AI deepFake video technology to create animations that they then painstakingly editted and stitched together into a semi-coherent product.
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Plus, they also filmed themselves. Which was why Andrew Ramblehurst was walking around in a burlap sack, pretending to be EcoFreak Eddy, Antarctica's #1 most notorious ecohorr'rist.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "The irresponsible mismanagement of phosphorus by the capitalist machine during the so-called «green revolution» has created a crisis that DWARVES the so-called falseFlag, bigBattery propaganda noise we called cLiMaTeChAnGe," <strike>Andrew</strike> EcoFreak Eddy said, pointing directly at the camera.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "My Eddy," Uriah Bleu said, wearing a monstrous mustahce and a babyBlue suit. "We're here to discuss your upcoming match against the King of Antarctica himself."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Eddy swatted away Uriah's hand. "You topHat MonopolyMenMurderers hid your greed behind images of starving children with bloated bellies, when <I>the real truth</I> is that you sought unlimited growth, exponential growth, exponential births, so you could have more CUSTOMERS! So you could have more PROFITS! So you could have MORE MONIES! So much monies that you could bathe in it. So you mined the terra for phosphorus, found it in rocks buried deep underground, because the phosophorus in our [faeces] wasn't enough! No, it's never enough! And you passed laws to stop peeing outside, another way to -- "
