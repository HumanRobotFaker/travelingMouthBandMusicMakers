           Much of the boys' productivity points came from this proRasslin' cos-play that Hector invented and bandoned after it became grossly successful. It was called Moon Championship Wrestling because - as the story goes - it origially started as a gov't-provided entertainment service for indentured servants working at moon mines, where they drilled for heavy hydrogen isotopes at the bottom of lunar craters. The work days were long, considering that the lunar day lasts 336 hours, and sometimes the workers just needed a lil' respite from the drugery. [To be clear :- there were no actual lunar colonies at the time.]
