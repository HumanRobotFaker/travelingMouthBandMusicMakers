                “Hector,” she said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What?” he said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<I>What are we doing?</I>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What do you mean ‘what are we doing?’?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Britni closed her eyes and exhaled. “Hector…”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Britni…”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “This isn’t working.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What do you mean ‘this isn’t working’?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Hector, you’re clearly not that thrilled to be around me.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “That’s not true.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You’re frustrated whenever I disagree with you.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I think that’s unfair.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I think that’s unfair if it was said <I>a few months ago</i>. But I think it’s completely fair right now.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    Hector rolled his eyes and leaned back on the staircase.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “See?” she said.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “See what?” he said.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “Look, <I>you</I> are the one who wrote fifteen poems in a two day period about <I>cheating</I> on me and feeling all guilty about it.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “That was <I>metaphorical</I>,” Hector said. “That was poetic <I>exaggeration</I>.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “And I,” she said, “don’t believe that. I think something happened and I tried to let it go, I mean, we’re not married and we won’t be together forever or anything. It’s just <I>insane</I> because I tried to have an open relationship with you. And you <I>begged me</I>, made me feel <I>guilty</I> about wanting to date other people. As if I was stabbing you in the throat. Wasn’t that the poem? ‘Stabbing you in the throat?’”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “I’m a writer,” Hector said. “I can’t censor myself.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “Sure. But after you wrote all those poems a couple months ago, you started getting all cold and weird and it’s just… What exactly is the point, Hector? It should be over. You clearly want something different.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “That’s not true,” he said and he started crying.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “It is true,” Britni said. “This isn’t healthy. We should go different ways. You know it, Hector. You know it.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “I don’t want this,” he said, tears streaming down his drunk face.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “I’m going to leave.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “<I>That’s it? We’ll never see each other again?</I>”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “What? No. But I think we should have some space. Some separation.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    And then Britni edged her way to the door, allowing Hector to walk her to her car. And she let him kiss her and then she opened the door, slipped into the driver’s seat, and drove away.
