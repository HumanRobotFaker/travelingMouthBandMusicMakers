<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Xiander woke up in the morning. And he didn’t get out of bed.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    He laid in bed and played chess with deaf-mutes in east Eurazikka. 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    This time, it took a few days for someone to arrive.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “<i>Xiander</i>,” his mother sang. “Hector Chavez is at the door. Can I let him in?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Sure,” Xiander said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector entered. “So, I saw you met with Ahriman himself, sri pHepL.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “The Ahriman, eh?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector nodded. “I’m dead serious.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “I bet you are.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Do you know the sri’s philosophy?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “To not move, even when others tell you to?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector looked at him strangely. “It’s essentially a rip-off of a little known author named Johann Kaspar. Kaspar the Ghost, they called him. Because he was obsessed with ghosts.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “The sri believes in ghosts?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector threw a dismissive hand. “No ghosts ghosts,” he said. “Metaphorical ghosts. The idea that ideas act as ghosts, the ones in folklore that possess the bodies of humans, making them do all sorts of evil, dastardly deeds.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “I thought those were <I>ghouls</I>, not <I>ghosts</I>.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector threw another dismissive hand. “Kaspar grew up in a time of great upheaval. The autocrats and capitalists of old were being decapitated and replaced by pseudo-democratic socialists. He watched gun battles happening in the street, and it all looked like madness to him.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Okay.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “So he composes this <I>idea</I> that ideas are akin to ghosts, taking possession of perfectly fine human beings, and then causing the humans to become zombies that do the bidding of the <I>ideas</I>.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Xiander nodded. “That seems reasonable.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector laughed. “It’s cynical. It’s a metaphor masquerading as fact.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Aren’t all metaphors?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “What? No. Metaphor literally means ‘part carrier’, giving an image of us taking one part of one thing over to another thing, and saying ‘see, those are kind of the same.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “They are the same.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector shook his head. “Anyhow, Kaspar thought you should only do things in your self-interest. That you shouldn’t let egalitarian notions of justice invade your brain and influence your actions. Nor loyalist notions of duty to nation, tribe, or religion.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Nor a ceaseless lust for pleasure and frivolity.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Anyhow, I just want you to know that Kaspar’s message – the sri’s message – is poison for the soul. The fruits might seem lucious and life-giving, but they contain an active ingredient that kills all joy in life.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    <I>“‘Metaphor masquerading as fact,’”</I> Xiander said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector threw a dismissive hand. “Don’t listen to the sri. Your dreams are not made to be destroyed and dismissed. They are to guide you down the corridors of the subconscious, until you find the room where Ahuramazda lives. And when you do, you will forever be changed.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Like a woolly bear caterpillar into an isabella tiger moth.”
