           <center><h1>   two-sided polygon    </h1></center>
            
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           Andrew yelled about triangles. Pentagons. Septagons. And then he was off ranting about the elusive 2-sided shapes.
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "There is no two-sided shape," I yawned. "It's called a line."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "No! No!" Andrew declared, the blanco with the fiery red hair. "A line is not a shape! There is no enclosed area in a line! A shape must have an interiour betwixt the sides!"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Why must there be a two-sided shape?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Because all prime numbers have shapes. Three-sided shape has 180° angles, half-a-circle, 2*2*3*3*5, five has 540°, 2*2*3*3*3*5!"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Okay but composite numbers have shapes too. And two doesn't. So I don't think the prerequisite number of sides has anything to do with prime numbers. I think it has to do with the number of vertices being at least three."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "No! No! That can't be true!" And then he took a piece of paper, folded it in two, and began staring intensely at its interiour, bending the non-connected ends to make them touch with an interiour.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "When you come to think about it," Winfield said, mouthing a flaming paper cylinder packed with injun and hindoo CIEs, which pissed trails of smoke, "how many sides is a circle? One side? Two side? Infinite side?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        I knew TMB University was a ponzi scheme, a parasite of the fed'ralgov't, because these jokesters - Andy particularly - were the highest ranking students in the southwest OIHO. What did Andy do 'xactly? Colour with crayons, convince others to colour with crayons, all the whilst waxing superphilosophical, espousing nonsensical tangents about cosmically connotated geo-political fictions in a shameless displace of verbosity that made the AI assessors go <B>DING-DING-DING!!!</B>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp And no matter how many correspondances I sent or essays I wrote to the authorities at TMB University, no corrections were made, and the NyleDroneDeliveries kept sending all the operant conditioning awards to these lunatics.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            And meanwhile, Andy and his ilk just ghosted me on the subject, pretending they'd installed a content-blocker app on their iContacts™, allowing their perceptual faculties to be totally shielded from topics and words that they wished to know nothing about (COMING SOON TO iCONTACTS™ 2042 EDITION).
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Well, MarsBar," Andy said. "You just should know that King Leroy has commanded all units to be on high-alert for the locating of the two-sided polygon."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Who is King Leroy?" I asked.
            "The King of Antarctica."
