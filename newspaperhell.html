<p>       Whilst traditionally I have been an advocate for skool choice and “money following the student”, I must warn about a troubling trend: Traveling Mouth Band University.
    
    <P> Traveling Mouth Band University is a charter skool “focused on providing special education”. Sounds good, right? But this skool isn’t providing special services for students who need extra help, such as a child with [insert congenital disorder], which renders them half-blind and unable to string a noun and verb together. No, this skool is about providing extra resources for students who need less help than the average student. Specifically: “Traveling Mouth Band University only serves qualifying students who test in the top 3% on the Dykle Intelligence Scale for Children.”
    
    <P>So they remove the smartest of the smart from our area private and publik skools. But how exactly do they “serve” these students?
    
    <P>First off, they do the opposite of what most special-needs skools do: they <i>increase</i> the student-to-teacher ratio. Instead of having a single staff designated to a single student (in the most extreme cases) or a couple staff focused on a handful of special needs children, TMB University has <I>a single staff member per 200 students</I>. 
    
    <P>Is that staff member a certified teacher? Maybe. But usually not.

       <p><img src ="images/News-AntarcticaJobsAd.png" >
    
    <P>Second off, instead of providing a safe, secure, central location for the daily gathering of children, TMB provides nothing. Nada. Zilch. There is no building. And since there is no building, who is watching these precocious youth to ensure they stay out of trouble and stay safe?
    
    <P>Nobody.

    <p>
<img src ="images/Dasanaquafina-AD.png" >
    </p>    
    
    <P>Instead, they mail students an iContact™ computer system and grant them unlimited [microwave-range electromagnetic emission and reception] as long as all data is funneled through their VirtualPrivateNetworks. These VPNs collects “auditorial, optical, and neurological input” and the skool relies upon s’posedly super-sophisticated algorithms to detect and categorize behaviours. If problematic behaviours occur, the skool primarily relies on “internal measures to problem-solve”, but leaves open the possibility of contacting local law enforcement for particularly egregious behaviour. 
    
    <P>So, considering TMB University doesn’t provide students with a building nor supervising adults, where does all the money go? 
    
    <P>To Ulaanbaatar AILOGNOM. 
      
      <P>That’s where TMB University is headquartered.
    
    <P>Nevertheless, some of that money does return to students. TMB, operating under a cynical notion that young people cannot be productive without extrinsic motivations, grants students financial credits. These credits can be spent at a number of vendors, who then NyleDroneDeliver equipment and supplies s’posedly for the purpose of helping students complete eduProjekts. Last February, a news story broke about one of these eduProjekts: a kid in Des Moines AWOI built a GrowRoom, producing and harvesting guatama flower buds, which he then sold to local skool-children. Apparently the supervising algorithms got tricked into thinking that the GrowRoom was for legitimate crops like potatoes rather than illicit psychoactive delivery systems.
    
   <h3> <P>“Hypointels” </h3>
    
    <P>But what is most troubling to me is the culture. 
    
    <P>Skoolchildren are always prone to factionalize. Jocks, Emos, Nerds, et cetera. Certain kids take honours classes and certain kids take the class that lets them count on their fingers. But they all met in the same cafeteria. They all went to the same skool assemblies. They all rode the same buses. 
    
    <P>But students at TMB don’t share these common experiences. Instead, they develop an insulated microculture that – surprise, surprise – denigrates those individuals who don’t qualify for their skool. They perform an ancient rite of dehumanization: name-calling. They call everyone not in TMB: “hypointels”.

<p class="sidestory">(CP Wire) A dozen individuals exiting a Matthewian Yeshian Temple were killed last Thursday when an exothermic chemical reaction positively accelerated tiny shards of shrapnel to high velocities causing their kinetic energy to fatally pierce through the individuals’ integumentary systems. A Luükian horr’rist group claimed responsibility in a twit-tick™ followed by a creekstream on infinispace™. 
    <p class="sidestory">
   “We just want to live in peace,” declared the executive leader of the Méjico Federal gov’t in a press statement released. “The treachery of these rogue individuals must be suppressed and eliminated; thus, I am calling on my compatriots in the legislative branch to cease obstructing the SafeStreets - HappyPeople bill that Emiliano de la Hoya is attempting to get out of the Interior Committee.” 
        
   <p class="sidestory">Luükian moderates caution that the legislation essentially merges the judicial and executive branches, creating an “imbalance of power” within the government. Cox News Syndicate Foreign Correspondent Zeus Tribble raised questions in a recent article about the timing of the event: those Matthewians weren’t leaving temple after a service; they were leaving forty minutes after midnight.  ###</p>
