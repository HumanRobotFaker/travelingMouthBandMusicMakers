           Brazil left and I immediately leapt into action. I went back upstairs and tried to enter the room he’d been in, but it was locked. But it was one of those fake locks without a real key, where you just found a skinny screwdriver or a hairpin, and you could unlock it. So I found a random piece of mulch off the carpet and unlocked it.

           As I suspected, no human was in there. The room was <I>foul</I>. Food and drink had been eaten in here and then left to ferment <I>for jaars </I>. The bed was broken, lopsided and resting atop a broken bedframe that didn’t allow one to slide objects underneath the bed. I looked in the closet and a few other places. But then I got a sneaking suspicion and <I>very carefully</I> lifted up the mattress, wholly expecting rats of cockroaches to leap up at me. And then I found it :- one of those RoxxxieVacuum suitcases. Albeit, this one was sleek, fancy, and obviously new. I pulled it out and ‘xamined the container, but it was locked with a combination code. I tried a few random combinations and then returned it to its original setting, before placing it back in the hidden compartment underneath the lopsided mattress.

           So I decided to cavity search Hector’s room. I flipped through notebooks, reached into jean pockets of dirty clothes, and scoured through the closet and dresser drawers. I didn’t find a suitcase anywhere, but I found a hardbound book stuck unceremoniously in a cardboard box that I found to be not his dream journal, but his <I>real</I> journal.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           The book started with him talking about cheating on his girlfriend, Britni, who attended B.C.E.C.; I already knew the details about that and the written record didn’t stray far from his oral account. He philosophized that he’d never truly loved her because he’d objectified her, turning her into some idyllic [angel], whose primary purpose was to bolster and increase Hector’s own misguided sense of self-value. She had assets, he felt, where he had flaws and he hoped her geoproximity would osmosis away the difference, transmogrifying Hector into a redeemable human being. These were Hector’s words, not mine.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           But while he tried to cast her in bronze, Britni continued to be a flesh-and-blood human being not <I>totally</I> aware of the mental gymnastics occurring in Hector’s head. Furthermore, she fell into his trap — a trap often leveled at <I>women</I> for setting — where he downplayed gift-giving and holydays as frivolous nonsense [because his borderline mother used gifts to guilt, manipulate, and control others], but <I>then</I> when he suddenly surprised her with a bouquet of roses on [Eros Day] and she had <I>nothing</I> in return, he lost his fukkin’ mind. He spiraled down a train of thoughts which were <I>highly</I> uncharitable but maybe not <I>totally</I> off-the-mark, because she probably was using him for her own self-interested ways (“she views me as «better than nothing, but someone to keep me company whom I somewhat enjoy»”, he wrote). So dot-dot-dot, Hector cheated on her. 
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           All of this, I already sort of knew. 
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           But then a name I’d never heard him utter made an appearance on the page. And the name kept appearing for page after page after page —
