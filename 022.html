           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "You know who else is free and liberated?" Khali said. "Shamshounian'chinegunners and suicideBombers. Until, you know, they're killed dead or locked in prison for the rest of their lives."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            We were in my backyard, helping my mother by sprinkling group 15 nonmetals onto her plant beds, and not mitigating the s'posed phosphorus crisis. Nearby, my mother sat on a bench, widdling a piece of pinewood with a knife, sculpting another character or setpiece for a scene from the <i>double-vey</i> (VehicularVerses™). Previously crafted shadow boxes were sprinkled about the garden.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "I would argue," I said, "that Shamshounians are <I>not free</I>. even if they are untethered by the moralistic norms of modern society, they are nonetheless <I>enchanted</I> and <i>possessed</i> by the delusion that it is their divine duty to <I>do something</I>, which is the anti-thesis of what Jakob [spoke]."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Khali wasn't there, but, after the fact, her Triple-A urgently told her to channel the «event» [(an AI compiled episode featuring different angles from different viewpoints to ensure maximum watchability)].
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Khali waved away my correction. "This nihilism is a spell in and of itself; a spell distracting you from its very nature by directing your focus onto the spell-like format of strong emotions of indignation and rage toward the exploitative framework of our economic system, attempting to render righteous rebellion into cartoonish haunted-house buffoonery."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Khali was referring to Jakob's commentary on his Commie John character, connecting Mark Carleson's reference to «a spectre haunting Europa» to a literal apparition-like ghoul possessing the corporeal bodies of workers, causing them to cease caring about their individual welfare  and, in a zombie-like fashion, begin groaning communist nine-syllable jargon, whilst uttering «must serve communism» as they marched toward civil war.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            At the time, I'd thought :- metaphore-metawhore.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Now, I said, "Khali, <I>who are you</I>? When did you become a revolutionary of the rebel cause?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Khali waggled her finger at me. "Don't try to redirect the conversation." Then she crumbpled up the plastic bag that used to contain the group 15 nonmetals. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "No, seriously," I said. "You've always been the staunch defender of our great-grandpappy. And now, you're calling everything <I>nihilism</I> and speaking glowingly of proletariat-uprisings. What's the deal?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            My mother, seated on the bench, widdling the piece of pine into a human-like figurine with a knife, interjected. "It is natural for the young to wish to destroy the world and rebirth it anew."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            I responded. "Said the mother condescendingly."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            My mother continued widdling. "I did <I>not</I> say condescendingly. I said <I>matter-of-factly</I>."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Khali turned to my mother. "It is not <I>our generation</I> that is destroying the world."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            My mother laughed. "As if it was <I>our generation</I> alone. As if generations are a real, concrete essence. As if there is any certainty that the world can even <I>be destroyed</I>."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "And that," Khali said, swinging back toward me, "is what the scholars call «the omni-denial of 'sponsibility»."
