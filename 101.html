           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

            A redhead teen, wearing a skout uniform sagging under the weight of a sundry cornucopia of medals and badges, paced in front of a dry erase board.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “What we need to do is stop people from <I>dreaming</I>.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Now wait a second,” Mister Allen said. “Why in the world would you want people to stop dreaming? Should we all just submit to the present reality without hope of change?” 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The redhead swiveled his head toward the middle-aged man. “We’re not talking about <I>metaphorical</I> dreams. Those produce lust and ambition and drive the economy. We’re talking <I>literal</I> dreams. Those must be stopped.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “But huh?” Mister Allen sputtered. “Why?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The redhead teen stared directly into Mister Allen’s eyes. “There is an endemic threatening the integrity of this generation; Doctor Dalton and his dastardly deceptions have teenagers sleeping away their entire lives!”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen blinked his eyes a number of times in rapid succession. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “You live in a state of naive oblivion?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Oblivious regarding a <I>new</I> threat regarding teen oversleeping?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The bedizened teen shook his head. “Laugh it up. But society is on the precipice and down below is the frozen caves of Kur.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen couldn’t help himself. “<I>Sounds</I> dramatic!” he sang.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Commander Rums!" the redhead called.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            A hypermuscular midget with golden locks emerged. “Sir, el generalissimo, sir!”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Commander Rums, will you please inform Mister Allen about the very dangerous threat that is Doctor Dalton?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Sir, yes, sir!" and the midget saluted. Then he turned to Mister Allen. “Follow me, Mister Allen.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            ******
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            They entered into the [empty space] building, which was ostensibly Mister Allen’s new office. The muscular midget ripped a newspaper print off the wall and handed it to Mister Allen. 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The headline read: WHAT EVIL DOES DOCTOR DALTON HAVE IN STORE FOR US?
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “According to the Sri, Doctor Dalton is transporting his horr’rist ideology from the West Coast to the MidWest,” the midget said.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “The Sri?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Sri pHepL.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen looked back down at the newspaper. 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            *******
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Escaping prosecution from the state of Oregon’s anti-bigamy and sex-trafficking laws, Doctor Don Dalton committed pseudo-suicide with the assistance of a corrupt county coroner, lying semi-alive on public display in a glass coffin in a perpetual lucid dream state. But alas, the wave-like disturbance of his philosophy continues to propagate across these here federated states, sweeping eastward akin to the [insert chemical compound] epidemic that destroyed rural communities earlier this decade.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            All physiologists and health experts agree that movement is essential to the well being of young persons. Yet Doctor Dalton’s cult not impeded by the “death” of their dear leader, continues to encourage young people to submit to inertial universal tendencies and lay in bed sixteen to twenty hours a day! In the process, young people isolate themselves from their families and communities, finding themselves more and more reliant upon “lucid dream counselors”, who guide the naive minds to spend more and more of their parents’ monies on faux-scientific technology s’posed to enhance the lucid dream capabilities of the purchaser.

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “His sons moved to Xenia,” the midget said.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Excuse me?” Mister Allen said.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Somnus and Morpheus. They recently moved to Xenia, hoping to capitalize on the anti-establishment sentiments of the quakershakers and the Ammonites who live there.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. He wanted to pull out his MOB and investigate all this noise, but TMB policy was explicit :- no MOBs for staff; iContacts™ for students. 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “So,” Mister Allen said, “you’re saying this cult leader — who sort of killed himself — has two biological spawn who’ve come to Dayton OIHO to propagate his message?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The midget nods. “
