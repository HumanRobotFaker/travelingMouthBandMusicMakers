 The Lunar Emporium was not open if there was only a single student present. I wanted to utilize the high-powered microscope there to look at some [CRISPR gene-edited] microbes, with which I’d attempted to replicate an experiment that caused heterotrophic creatures to <i>only</i> eat autotrophic creatures (based on a detectable chemical signature connected to the photosynthetic process). <s>The initial experiment was loudly heralded by vegan clickbait across the globe for about sixty kiloseconds.</s> No one of my normal crew was available at that moment, so I called <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil Chavez</span> to see if he would accompany me. 
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “Sure,” he said.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 We met at the Lunar Emporium and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> unlocked everything. I went to work while <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> made espresso for them to drink and rolled filterless cigarettes for them to smoke outside in the front area.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 With my MOB, I recorded the interactions occurring in the petri dish and found my experiment to be a failure. The altered microbes still eventually devoured a heterotroph in phagocytosis and absorbed it.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> eventually meandered back inside, rinsing out their espresso demitasses in the sink.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “You know,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span>. “I found those addiction programs to be helpful <i>in the beginning</i>, But their unending focus on simply abstaining or avoiding, leaves you in this weird middle Barzakh land. Luckily, a buddy back then connected me to this man who helped me take it to the <i>next level</i>.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “Dr. Don Dalton?” I asked, interrupting their conversation.
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> looked over at me. “‘mazda no!” He shook his head and looked back at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span>. “You could actually meet this man. He does a circuit and returns every half-year. He’s down in a Dayton neighborhood by the art museum.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “Sure!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> said. “I love new experiences.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 “Can I come?” I asked. “My experiment was a failure, by the way.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
 <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> said, “Sometimes it works that way. And yes, you can come.”
 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
******************
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Señor de la Luna,” I said, as a robo-uber ferried us to the location, “I didn’t realize you were a recovering addict.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> laughed. “I am still pretty addicted to cigarettes and caffeine.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“But you were addicted to something else?”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Anything that gave me pleasure, basically. Anything that changed the magnification and focus on the lenses that are my perspectives. Anything that created chaos, got my blood boiling, and gave me a story to tell. I grew up in the Matthewian tradition, so the experts there would’ve said that I simply let my rahjah goonyuh stay dominant for too large a ratio.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“And that means….?” I asked.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> threw a hand in dismissal. “Don’t worry about it. Maybe <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> can tell; he’s [EUB] too.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> shook his head. “We’re Luükian. We don’t do that goonyuh business.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Anyhow,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> said. “To simply run around, chasing pleasure is going to cause trouble. With the law, with yourself, and with others.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“So you just stopped?” I asked.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Well, I originally tried to just throw all my efforts at making the other two goonyuhs dominant all the time – effectively to oscillate between pretending I was a lazy, inertia-dominated rock and a selfless do-gooder. But the problem is that third goonyuh always finds a way to sneak its way up to the top. And it’s so much effort shoving it back down. Isn’t that right, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span>?”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I’m a bit lost in the metaphor,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> said, “but, sure, yes, definitely.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> shook his head. “Not a metaphor. A vivid description of objective reality.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

******************
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The robo-uber took us to a nondescript house. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> and I followed <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> up the stairs. At the door, Señor rapped his knuckles against the door to the tune of [baa baa black sheep].
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The door opened and a man in a bright ornj robe greeted us quietly. We entered and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor</span> – clearly knowing the way – led us downstairs to a basement.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The basement was crowded with folks in ornj robes and folks in plainclothes. It was nearly silent, except the sound of feet shuffling, as people seemed to be doing a dance. At the front of the room, atop a slightly elevated stage, an [acharya]-type individual sat, unmoving.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
We stood in the back of the crowded room, as everyone wiggled and danced quietly. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor</span> nodded at us and then began dancing, so we followed suit.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Then the dancing stopped, everyone bowed toward the seated man, and then sat down on the floor. The heat from everybody’s exothermic bodies was palpable.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Thank you for joining us today,” the man spoke. “You could be anywhere today, following [modern] society’s illusory dictates and necessities, dragging yourself through the day. But instead you chose to be here. And I thank you for that.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<B><I>“As we thank you, sri pHepel,”</I></B> the crowd chorused.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I had a dream!” the sri said, holding up his pointer finger. “My mother, who has long been dead, rushed toward me. She told me that there had been reports that my father – also long dead – had been found, sifting for gold, along the beach, along the beach of a continent, the farthest continent in the whole universe. And you know what I did?”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<B><I>“NOTHING!”</I></B> the crowd chorused.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
This made the sri crack up in laughter. And this laughter caused the crowd to start laughing. And, as a member of the crowd, I found it difficult for <u><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">me</span></u> to <i>not</i> laugh.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“This compulsion,” the sri continued. “This compulsion to <i>do something</i>. How much trouble it causes us! How much disaster could have been avoided if we could simply have let that compulsion pass through the auras of our bodies. Let the compulsion pass through like clouds in the sky pass through. The clouds may rain; they may snow; but they also pass on over the horizon.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
There was a pause. I heard someone readjust themselves and I heard someone fart.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> smirked at me and then we both looked back forward.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“You may have heard the commonplace saying: – ‘the evil men accomplish their ends when the righteous men look on and do nothing’. It sounds convincing, doesn’t it? It sounds like you must <i>do something</i>.” The sri held up his pointer finger again. “That is the dream. That is the dream trying to <i><b>rope you in</b></i>,” and then the sri started pulling on an imaginary rope, as if he was propelling himself forward with it. 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The crowd responded in mimicry, pretending they were passing a rope through their hands, as they pulled themselves forward.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The sri stopped pulling. “Has anyone dreamed and not done anything? And when they didn’t do anything, they <b><I>died?</I></b>”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
A few hands in the crowd went up.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“What happened then?” the sri asked.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I woke up,” a teenage boy offered.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The sri nodded. “Very common.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I died and went to kur,” [an indeterminant] said.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Oh yes,” the sri laughed. “And what happened there?”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“They exposed me to the WorstThingEver™. And it was horrible. And every time I tried to roll away and escape it, it only got worse. There was no escape.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Sounds horrifying.” The sri then pointed and scanned his face across the crowd. “You all better <i>do something</i>.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The crowd laughed.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The sri looked at the [indeterminant]. “And so how did you respond to this development?”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Well,” the [indeterminant] said, “immediately, I freaked out and woke myself up. But, for the future dreams, I prepared myself in waking life to realize that even kur was part of the dream. Even kur was simply a manifestation of my own consciousness over which I had control.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The sri nodded. “Did you ever return to kur?”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Yes, but its illusory quality was apparent to me then.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The sri nodded. Then the sri scanned the crowd. “Let us bedrock upon this,” he said and then he closed his eyes. Everyone closed their eyes. So I followed along.
