           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           "Religion is just a bunch of fairy tale [faeces]," Påo[la] said to me. It was my turn, so I walked up to the ball return table and picked up my lime green [bowling] ball. Down the oily lane, the robot reset the pins and then got out of the way. I tried to do the wrist-twist dealio that the TVpros do, but it just went directly into the gutter.
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           I walked back to the return table. "It's easy to simpy dismiss something out of hand," I said. "To just say it's all gibberish and throw it in the rubbish refuse bin."
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            The limegreen ball returned.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "It's hard not to," Påo said. "I mean, you know how yeshians used to use hippos to quarter heretics to death? Well, <I>if they still could</I>, they'd do that to me. In a heartbeat."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            I picked up the ball and made my approach. This time I didn't bother with the wrist-twist and just let the heavy, polished rock go end-over-end down the center of the oily lane. It drifted left and, at the end, it clipped three pins on the edge. I returned toward the seats at Påo stood up. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Girl," Påo said, "you can't bowl worth [faeces], but your booty look good doin' it."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            I didn't know how to respond to that. If a cis male did that, I'd've punched 'em in the shoulder. But Påo being M-to-F, much to my own chagrin, changed my calculations.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Gross," I finally said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Påo laughed. "What type of femminist are you again?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            I narrowed my eyes. "Excuse me?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Are you tetrahedron? Octahedron? Triangular bipyramid?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Påo walked past me to pick up the ball. The robot did the pin reset and I sat down. Påo had seemed interesting on QTmeet™ (artist, trans, funny), but it appeared that meatHead stereotypical masculine norms had struck again. Påo was an arse.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Påo hurled the heavy black ball and it spun sideways, seeming to float above the oily lane, before striking the triangular formation of pins just off-center, sending all ten of them flying every which way in a thunderous cacophony.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Påo came back and I was still seated.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Which one are you?" Påo asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Of these three-dimensional shapes with triangular faces?" I said. "This some kind of joke?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "No. But what I'm really asking is :- are you an anti-sex femminist who thinks men should be quiet, docile, lil' wall-flowers who never assert themselves until given 'xplicit permission from the council of matriarchs?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Look," I said. "I just don't wanna <I>hear</I> your nasty commentary about the part of my body that I sit on and [faeces] out of."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Okay," Påo said. "I'll keep my thoughts to myself."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Good."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            And then we sat in silence.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Are you gonna bowl?" Påo asked. "We only have a few more frames left."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            I thought about refusing. Or leaving. But I didn't wanna feel like being seen as an ultra-dramatic, psycho bicch, so I just stood up and let Påo look at whatever Påo was gonna look at.
