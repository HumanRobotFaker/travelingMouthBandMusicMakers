    On the night of the equilibrium – 11 hours awake and 11 hours asleep – the part migrated to Hector’s house. Hector’s hours were all flipped around, so he was awake during this time. 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector’s house was a trash heap. Objects were broken and never repaired, sweeping and mopping with anathema to the inhabitants, and the residence seemed to be cluttered with random objects of no import. So, prior to the party, whilst Hector was still asleep, the trio relocated much of his belongings into the subterranean, half-finished basement. Horizontal surfaces were wiped clean. 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector awoke, but stayed in his room. Andrew brought out candles, cleared Hector’s floor of dirty clothes and spiral notebooks, and played the role of the eager disciple.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Great Hector,” Andy said. “Tell us of your visions from the dreamscape.”
