<P> <span class="indigostart">_</span><span class="indigo hoverable" id="luuk">Luuk Kowski</span><span class="indigoend">_</span> handed Hector a silver-coloured can of yeefass <span class="white-emphasis">(yeast-fouled aqueous solution)</span>.

<P> "Chavez," Luuk said, "I hear you dropped out of skool? You helping your dad smuggle <span class ="censored">[redacted]</span> across the border?"</p>

<p> "Stop," Hector said, ripping open the top of the can and taking a long pull.</p>

<p> Luuk shrugged his shoulders and looked across the room at all the people at the party. 
</p>

<p> "But you did drop out?" Luuk said. "Right?"</p>

<p> "No," Hector said. "I transferred to this online giftedSkool."</p>

<p> "<I>GiftedSkool?</I>" Luuk said, purring. <I>"Fancy."</I> </p>

<p> Hector took another massive drink, almost finishing the 35 centiliter can. "It's probably some sort of skimming scheme. But they give me kickbacks." </p>

<p> "Kickbacks?"</p>

<p> "Yeah. Like, instead of getting grades for doing skoolWork, they give us presents. Rides in roboTukTuks and all."</p>

<p> Luuk grinned. "You gonna give us rides to the next party?"</p>

<h1>.031</h1>

<P> The presents weren't presents, persay. They were investments into skool supplies for eduProjekts, and, thus, required some sort of intellectual justification, regardless of the obvious mental gymnastics that was being performed. The [AI] assessor didn't need it to convince arbitrators of the premier court of the federated states; it just needed <I>something</I>. </P>

<P> Hector found that the terminalogy: <I><B>"Underground Investigative Reporting"</B></I> <span class ="white-emphasis">(UIR)</span> tended to work. </P>
   
<p class="radio"> The females at this party have zero interest in me. None. Zilch. Regardless of my proximity to their persons, they continue speaking as if I don't exist. As if I am a phantom ethereal spirit that they simply cannot sense. So I open up another yeefass and continue following around the boys that I know from primary skool: Luuk, Jarrod, Klark, & Burns, as they ask me about manly things like wrestling and this moderately attractive [azian] girl they saw me with many moonths ago.  
    </p>

<p class="radio"> Why I am here is a mystery to me, but maybe it shouldn't be. I want to obliterate my self and forget all my narrative woes. Destroy my memory and escape from the prison of my personality. These people don't care about my religious beliefs nor do they cast a skeptical eye against my actions in comparison to some theological ideal toward which I fail to live. None of that matters to them. Barely anything matters to them. Seemingly. 
</p>

<p class="radio"> Burns has a new MOB that allows one to project foreground-only images into a three-dimensional environment viewable to others from all X-Z angles. So, naturally, in concordance with behavioural predictions embedded within subsects of evolutionary theory, he utilizes this state-of-the-art technology to propogate photons depicting gratuitous obscentities that yielded annoyed sighs and eye-rolls from the female population. Yet Burns <u>does</u> have a girlfriend, who sits quietly on the couch, undisturbed by her boyfriend's tomfoolery, long calloused by his actions and unbothered as long as he says her name at the end of the night to invite her to accompany him on the ExitFromTheParty.   </p>

<p class="radio"> Luuk, Jarrod, and a couple of girls join me in a roboTukTuk that ferries us down black rivers to a giant low-rent apartment complex in RiverSide, where I ended up incredibly face-to-face with one of the most hated men on the internet circa [five jaars ago]: Ronnie Reynolds, the lumpy blanco who called the police on [a lumpy marron] in the BeaverCreek <span class="coin">¢</span>oin$aver because the latter was poking kitty litter with an unboxed airSoftRifle. Nobody made a big thing about it, and it seemed like Luuk already knew him, so I just acted like nothing was new to me, drinking another can of yeefass, and looking boredly at the sedition flag on the wall, where someone had sharpied the shamshounSymbol.

    <h1>.032</h1>

    <P> Hector woke up on a floor. For a moment, he wasn't sure where he was. Who he was. What anything was. Then Hector stirred, turned his head, felt a wave of nausea, and saw Luuk sleeping on the couch nearby. </P>

<p> They were no longer in that RiverSide apartment.</p>

<p> Hector reached for his MOB, but there was no MOB in his pocket.
</p>

<p> He went back to sleep.</p>

<h1>.033</h1>

<p> "Dude, you were a hot mess," Klark told Hector.

<p> "Yeah?" Hector asked. His head throbbed in pain.</p>

<p> "You started crying about some Britni <span class ="censored">[censored]</span>, tried to rip off all your clothes, and then threw your MOB into some random person's bushes. We tried to find it for you, but then the floodlights turned on and we had to get the kur outta there."</p>

<h1>.034</h1>

<p> Hector went back to the address. He bicycled over to the address, threw up a few times along the way, and popped in a fistfull of breath mints Klark'd given him. There were no cars in the driveway and nobody milling on the street, so Hector decided to peek in the bushes. They were well-trimmed and Hector figured he'd find them quick. But then the door opened and <U>Milly Yoder</U> popped her head out.

    <p> "I figured you'd come back looking for your MOB," she laughed. </p>

   <p> Hector looked up and vaguely recognized a girl from primary skool. </p> 

   <p> "Oh 'mazda," she said. "You should see my bellCamera. Do you remember <I>anything</I> from last night? </p>

<p>Hector walked over to her and looked at the ground by her bare feet. Then he looked at her and grinned. "Not really. Like vague shadows on the wall."

<p> "My parents asked me if I knew you, and I was like, yeah, he's one of those good yeshian boys in honours class at the conCenter. Come in. Want coffee?"</p>

<p> Hector followed her in. She was dressed in pajama shorts and a t-shirt, and he became overwhelmed with an animal lust. She took him into her kitchen and they sat down at round table. Nothing looked expensive, but everything was organized. She poured him a small cup of coffee from a plunger-press that was already set at the table. He'd never drank coffee before but he didn't say no. </p>

<p> "You want cream and sugar?" she asked. Her the interiour of her mug looked white as milk. "I know you're a wrestler, so you probably don't want the calories."</p>

<p> "Yeah, no cream or sugar," Hector said.
</p>

<p> "So black?"</p>

<p> "Yeah, black," Hector said, not entirely sure what that was.
</p>

<h1>.035</h1>

<p> The black coffee tasted bitter and terrible to Hector. She looked at him quizically. </p>

<p> "Where are your parents?" Hector asked.</p>

<p> "Work. It's a Tuesday."

<p> "Sure, but people work different schedules."</p>

<p> "What schedule do your parents work?"</p>

<p> "My dad's schedule is very erratic. He travels far away to do freelance work. He's not home right now."</p>

<p> "And your mom?"</p>

<p> "She works the graveyard shift," Hector said.</p>

<p> "So your parents didn't teach you about normal work hours," Milly said, and the tone boiled Hector's blood, but he just sat there and took another sip of his black coffee. </p>

<p> She took a longer sip. "What were you so upset about? I couldn't understand any of the audio."</p>

<p> "I don't know. I blacked out. My friends said it was about this girl I liked. I made a move on her recently and she got mad. She has a boyfriend."</p>

<p> Milly laughed. "Boyfriend is probably cheating on her."</p>

<p> Hector looked at her strangely.</p>

<p> "Boys are dogs. It's like their <span class="censored">[redacted]</span> is a pressure hose that will explode if they don't spray it everywhere."</p>

<p> Hector was taken aback. He wasn't used to girls speaking so crudely.</p>

<p> "Don't act like I'm crazy," Milly said. Then her hand swept some sugar packets off the table. "Oops," she said, and then got out of her chair, turned her back to Hector, and then leaned over without bending her knees. </p>

<p> She sat back down. "I bet that got your <span class="censored">[redacted]</span> twinging. "Seeing the undercurves of my ass?" </p>

<p> Hector felt a fight-or-flight response racing through his body. He didn't like this. Instead he <I>froze</I>. Instead, he said, "Well, of course I did. You have a nice ass."</p>

<h1>.036</h1>

<p> "It's not your fault," Milly said. "It's just biology." </p>

<p> They were now in Milly's room, which was painted bright yellow with accents of indigo, and Hector was seated on her bed like a dog following an owner with peanut butter treats.</p>

<p> "Biological Determinism, eh?" Hector said.</p>

<p> Milly frowned. "I have no idea what you just said."</p>

<p> "Free Will is a farce," Hector said. "You input stimuli and output automatically arises. No conscious decisions required." </p>

<p> "I don't know all about that," she said. Then she grabbed a book and threw it at Hector. </p>

<img src ="images/millybook.png" class="prime2">

<p> Hector read the cover, and then started flipping to the inside. "Pretty cynical."</p>

<p> "Cynical is a nasty word for seeing clearly," she said. "That's in the book."</p>

<p> He flipped through the pages and she'd underlined that very phrase in one of the initial pages.</p>

<h1>.037</h1>

<p> Milly sat down on the bed next to him and took the book. Then she laid on her back and held her hands over her head. </p>

<p> "You want to feel 'em?' she asked. </p>

<p> "What?"</p>

<p> "My boobs," she said. "I bet you wanna feel them."
</p>

<p> She reached down and squeazed one, and then returned her hands over her head.</p>

<p> "Go ahead. I won't tell Britni."</p>

<p> Hector was unsure. He put his hand on her stomach instead.</p>

<p> "Have you felt a girl's boobs before?" she asked.</p>

<p> Hector felt uncomfortable with her calling them <I>«boobs»</I>. "Yes," he said."

<p> "How many times?" she asked.</p>

<p> He pretended to take a count. An inventory. "Eleven," he said.</p>

<p> "<I>Eleven?</I>" she said, surprised. </p>

<p> Hector shrugged. </p>

<p> "You lie."</p>

<p> "I don't."</p>

<p> "How many let you feel underneath the bra?"</p>

<p> "Two."</p>

<p> "If you can unsnap my bra with one hand, I can be your third."</p>

<p>She rolled to her side and Hector ran his hand underneath her shirt, up her back, and found her bra strap. He used his forefinger to push the hook strap toward the ring strap, while the rest of his fingers stabilized the ring strap. He let go and it was unhooked. </p>

<p> "Wow," she said. "I didn't know you were such a player."</p>

<p> Hector shrugged. "I had some bad girls teach me in junior high."</p>

<p> "Who?"</p>

<p> "They went to Kettering. You wouldn't know them." </p>

<p>Milly slipped her bra straps down her arms and pulled it through her sleeves. </p>

<h1>.038</h1>

<p> Hector felt them. They felt like helium-filled balloons that had leaked for a month, slowly sinking to ground level, unable to levitate the mass of the latex balloon. Like old grapes, without much give. </p>

<p> "Any of those bad girls let your put their mouths on it?" Milly asked. </p>

<p>"No," Hector said. "I've never done that." </p>

<p> "Oh? So I can be your first. I know boys like firsts. And numbers."</p>

<p>Hector paused, and looked at her body. </p>

<p>"Have you done it before?" he asked. "Let a boy do that?" </p>

<p> "Oh yeah, my boyfriend used to do it all the time. He loved it. Boys are weird. It's not like milk comes out.</p>

<p> Hector couldn't help himself. He tried it. </p>

<p> "Ow!" she said. "Not that hard."</p>

<P> "Sorry."</P>

<P> Hector mouthed her. One and then the other.</P>

<P> "Do you like that?" she asked.</P>

<p> "Yeah," Hector said. "Do you?"</p>

<p> She smiled down at him. "I feel nothing. It does absolutely nothing for me."</p>

<h1>.039</h1>

<p> That night, Hector went back to Luuk's house. </p>

<p> "Did you find your MOB?" Luuk asked.</p>

<p> "Yeah, it was in the bushes," and Hector showed the unscathed device.</p>

<p> "Dude, I imagined that would be absolutely shattered. It literally bounced off their brick wall."</p>

<p> Hector shrugged, and began sucking down glass bottles filled with yeefass.</p>
