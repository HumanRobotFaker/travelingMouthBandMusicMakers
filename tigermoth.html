<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
When my brother was little, he brought home a <mark class="markred"><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tickle">woolly bear caterpillar</span></mark> from the woods near our skool. He built a terrarium with one of mom’s glass casserole dishes, kept it in his room, and diligently refreshed its supply of foliage to eat and branches to climb.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
One day, “tickle”, the woolly bear caterpillar, built itself a crystallis to live inside. We found it on one of the propped up sticks.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Will Tickle become a butterfly?” my lil’ brother asked.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I don’t think so…” and then I looked it up on my [MOB]. “Tickle will become something called an isabella tiger moth.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Back then, I was a bit more peevish about sharing the brutal factoids about the world, so I failed to disclose the following: tiger moths emerged from the cocoon without mouth pieces. Their sole functionality was to fly around and find other tiger moths with which to mate. Meanwhile, they slowly, inevitably, starved to death.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
But we never reached that pinnacle of metamorphosis. Because one day, my little brother looked in the terrarium and found a <I>housefly</I>. And upon closer inspection, there was a hole in the crystallis.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Did Tickle become a housefly?” he asked.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
No. Yes. In a way. A grisly, horrific way. You see, lil’ brother, once upon a time, before you pulled tickle off the bark of some random tree, a mama housefly landed on tickle, stabbed its ovipositor into ‘em, and installed a fertilized egg inside tickle’s flesh. And one day, that egg hatched and the larvae began feasting on the flesh all around. And, inside the chrysalis, that larva feasted and feasted until tickle was all eaten up.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
And that’s the story of tickle.
