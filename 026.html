   The shape of the aeroplane wing and the shape of the turbine blades (spinning becasue of the exothermic jet fuel combustion) manipulated the structure of our gaseous atmosphere to have the pressure-gradient force liberate us from the tyranny of gravity's incessant warping of empty space. We flew off the terra, up through the clouds, and then there was nothing to see out the window except the blue sky, the white puffy cumulous clouds below, and the everblazing sol.

    My mother, seated beside me, sobbed silently. My father and brother, across the aisle, slept like a couple of leaned over dominoes.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    I put my hand on my mother's back to let her know I cared. But I didn't say anything because my teen edition of the VehicularVerses™ recommended simply «being with the person» who is grieving. Not 'xplaining. Not attempting to placate them with mythological tales of Vahalla. Just be there. Validate their pain.
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I'm just worried about my sister," she 'xplained.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        I nodded.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Their two babies," she said, bursting into tears by the second syllable. I rubber her back while she hid her tears with her hands. Then she unpursed some tissues and blew her nose. I pulled out an airline barf bag and she tossed the snotty tissues in there.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Thanks," she said.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        I smiled.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Khali's family arrived earlier, so her older brother, Keivan, picked us up in the rental car even though he was under twenty-five jaars. My dad sat in the front and discussed my cousin's university life, his studies as an engineering undergraduate, and whether or not his girlfriend and him were «anything serious». My mother feined sleep and leaned against the window. I looked over at [my little brother] and watched him play a stupid blikblok game on our mother's MOB. I'd left behind my iContacts™ as permitted by TMB-U policy, and found the whole MOB concept to be <I>trés gauche</I>.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Eventually, the men stopped talking and my cousin looked back at me through the rear view mirror. "Mari," he said. "I thought I heard you had thrown away your headdress in sympathy with the women in eurazzikka?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Well," I said, half-tempted to tell him that I just didn't feel like embarrassing my parents with my [buzzed] head. "I felt like the situation warranted it."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        He nodded in the rear view mirror, glanced at the road ahead, and then looked at me with a prolonged eye contact. Everyone else was distracted on their MOBs. Then I remembered a time four jaars before when we played truth-or-dare and he asked to see my bra and panties. I broke the eye contact and looked out the side window, hoping to dissuade him of attempting some fool notion like cornering me into a distance farflung corner of the funeral home or Auntie's house. I looked at my mom, whose eyes were closed as she smashed her cheek against the cold [plasti]glass.
