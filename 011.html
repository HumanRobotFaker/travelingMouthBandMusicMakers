        I woke up early in the morning, completely exhausted, staring at a Venn Diagram of shadows created on the rug by two ceiling lights and my head. What had I been dreaming about? Surely it was something. But alas, my head was blank. It was as if I had not dreamed at all.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Hector always remembered his dreams. You went up to his room and, amongst the piles of dirty clothes and broken bits of crayon, there was spiral notebook piled atop spiral notebook piled atop spiral notebook, all inked to utter completion with the psychotic hyperdetailed description of his dreams. It took him one to two hours every day to write it all down. Sometimes, he woke up multiple times throughout the night to transcribe 'em. He'd been doing it for jaars, ever since his dad died.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        This regiment would've been difficult to maintain with a regular publikskool skedule, but with TMB Uni, this type of nonsensical navel-gazing was considered proper coursework. I mean, I s'pose it's not total nonsense: any acts of extensive writing are supportive of cultivating the scribe-skill in general. So I guess it's somewhat reasonable that Hector received credit for writing records of his dreams, composing religious + philosophical speculation, and - ahem - typewriting screenplays of fictional pro wrestling TV shows he hiveminded with a couple dozen dudes across the globe (as part of a competitive game).
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        I, nondream-recorder, honed my obsolete writing skills with recreations of historical optical experiments: measuring reflection, absorption, and transmission rates of varying semi-translucent plastics. Amongst other acts. You'd be surprised by how many humans still think that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects because they have no appreciable understanding of inertia nor the three laws of motion. But maybe you wouldn't be surprised. This is the federated states, after all. 
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Land of the free means land of the free to be dumb.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Hector believed everybody could be salvaged. They could be born in a garbage dump, raised by beasts with foreheads the size of drive-in movie theatres, and still be rendered into decent, exceptionally talented human beings possessing persistence and dilligence. As I grew older, I became more and more skeptical of these claims.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        So many people know next to nothing and have zero desire to learn anything to any depth whatsoever. In fact, they growl with antipathy if one tries to lead them in that direction.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        I s'pose that's why Hector spent so much time in his dream world. Or writing about his dream world. There, one could warp human beings into any image that one saw fit.
