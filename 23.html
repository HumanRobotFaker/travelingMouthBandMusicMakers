            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> laughed. “Who reads <i>newspapers</i> anymore?” as he pawed thru the edition <s> <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah Bleu</span></s> Commie John gave me earlier that morning (whilst we worked on his Penguin ‘Rasslin’ League projekt). <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> bit into the side of her burrito, before pinching the tortilla with her thumb + index fingers and just <i>shaking</i> the whole ensemble until the tortilla unraveled and all its innards spilled out. Then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> held the emptied tortilla as far away as possible and dropped it on the floor. A patron at the far end of the TacoHat™ glared in open disgust. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> nonchalantly slid out of the booth, picked up the tortilla, and quickly tossed into the nearby rubbish can.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 
                “It’s just so <i>stupid</i>,” I said. “The event took place on a Friday <i>evening</i>, involved <i>a lot</i> of BCEC students, and they’re gonna blame it on TMB not <i>babysitting</i> us?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> shrugged. “It’s just about getting clicks and subscripts from the hypointels. It’s really hilarious how outrage hooks us humans. This AI-bot assisted bozo is outraged about a broken window, bemoaning it as an emblem to the GreatUnRavelingOfCivilization [GURC], and now <i>we’re</i> outraged at <i>his</i> outrage, which – if aired in a publik forum – would outrageously cause <i>someone else</i> to be outraged at the audacity of <i>our</i> privileged outrage.” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> took a tiny bite of a tiny taco. He chewed; he swallowed. “It’s a verifiable cancer cell, just a mutant that keeps copying itself, and eating its neighbour, before getting eaten by a fourth-generation offspring of itself.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 
                “<i>Really</i>,” I said. “A <i>cancer</i> metaphor? From the guy bemoaning the overuse of hyperbolic metaphors in everyday life?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> swatted a dismissive hand at me. “That was LastWeekMe. I don’t even know that guy.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                Then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> T-T’d me a newspaper article <i>in progress</i> that he was having an AI write from the POV of an anonymous commander in the Penguin Liberation Front. The gist of the article was how <B><I>Bounce!™</B></I> emblemized the Kingdom’s excess, waste, and debauchery, as well as their utter disregard for the safety and well-being of others and their properties. I T-T’d him an AI-art image I bred that showed a baby penguin who’d lost their eye from an errant Bounce!™. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> added it to the newspaper article.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                We finished our meal, and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> half-ass cleaned up after  <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> before we went out the door. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> led <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> into the caged chariot that  <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> + the skouts had welded together, before we both climbed into the front two seats and started pedaling.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Peddle fast,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. On the way to TacoHat™, he’d told me that <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> liked it when the vehicle went fast and she stayed more calm that way. At home, she often sat in front of a fan, so <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> theorized that she liked the way the wind felt on her face.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                As we whizzed down a long, straight, residential street, we saw a person promenading in the distance. And as we approached, our AAAs identified the human to be <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector Chavez</span>’s big brother <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span>. This was wild, because <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> had told me that <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> lived way out in West Tejas.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Hey!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> hollered, as he stopped pedaling the chariot. “Are you <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> Chavez, big brother of the incredible lucid dream prophet known as <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                This man, in his late twenties, stopped and laughed. “You must be one of my brother’s cyborg skoolmates. What do we [have] inside here?” and he peered into the caged chariot. Instead of recoiling from what he saw, he just sort of froze.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Yeah, she’s monstrous,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, “but you get used to her. She’s my parents’ curse from Ahuramazda for having an inter-racial marriage.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Oh?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> said, backing away from the cage. “I didn’t realize that Ahuramazda was racist.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Weird,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> retorted. “That’s <i>the first thing</I> I realized about Ahuramazda.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                I extended my hand and introduced myself. “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander Xu</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Brazil Chavez. Hey do y’all have any idea where everyone is at my house? I’ve been waiting over two days for anyone else to show up, but there’s no signs of life despite the whole place being turned into a crayoned shrine to Antarctica.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> elbowed me. “Looks like the palace is free for occupation by the PLF [Penguin Liberation Front].”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Ummm, [y’all’s youngest brother] Oskar lives in his girlfriend’s basement,” I said. “Your mom’s WhoKnowsWhere, and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> is currently incarcerated in a juvenile psychiatric facility in northFieldSpring.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Wait, <I>what?</I>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Yeah,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. “Hector tried a DIY lucid dream marathon like Dr. Dalton. Built himself a glass coffin and everything, waking up with a daily timer just to swallow more sleeping pills and go back down under again. Apparently y’all’s mom thought he was dead when she found him and called the police. When they woke ‘im up, he started jabbering that he was Ahuramazda-yeshi-incarnate, destroyer of galaxies, so they tossed him in the looney bin.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “I write <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> letters there,” I added. “He told me that he should be out in a couple lunar rotations.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Woah…” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> said. “My mom got me thrown in juvie, but never a psychWard.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “So,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. “Whaddya doin’ in our neck of the woods? Don’t you live out in the west Tejas desert?” In the back, Loretta’s guttural noises were increasing in amplitude.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Oh, I do,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> said, getting squirrelly. “But apparently the cosmos have compelled us Chavez boys to be institutionalized. I just got out of rehab in South FLEUR.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Oh,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> and I both said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Why’d you go?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Ordinary ole yeast-water,” he said. “And, you know, suhtawree.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                Neither <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> nor I responded to that. But  <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span>’s volume grew louder and louder.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Hey, I don’t mean to be rude,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, “but I gotta keep moving to placate my sister back there.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
                “Oh! No problem! Maybe I’ll see y’all around,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> said. “You’re welcome to stop by the house.”
