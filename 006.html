           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Marissa," my mother said over my shoulder as I played chess. "You should understand that you come from a long line of strong, educated women."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "<I>Mom</I>," I said. "What does <I>that</I> have to do with ANYTHING?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Marissa. It's your <I>genetics</I>. It's anything <I>but</I> irrelevant."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Why do you always interject with such nonsense? We're talking about how humans drink and drug themselves into cerebral oblivion and you bring up how my great-great grannie was a chemist using her big brain to help a despot <I>gas</I> the plebians."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Honey, be kind to your mother," my father said. "Check," and he tapped on the elephant that suddenly threatened my king by the removal of an obstruction.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "I am just stating," my mother continued, "that not everyone is born with such innate gifts that are required for genius, like the ability to delay gratification or eschew it altogether if it is tethered with unsavory elements or complicate factors."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "That's garbage liberal talk, mama," I said, moving a horsie into a protected spot that shielded the king from the elephant's attack. "People make choices. And they should be judged for those choices. Otherwise, omni-denial of responsibility will sweep across everything like a plague."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Dad laughed.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "What?" I said.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        He shrugged his shoulders and studied the board with a smirk.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "I know it <I>feels</I> nice to believe such sentiment," my mother said. "To think that one is the sole actor and point of causation for all one's successes. And that others are the reason behind all their disasterous decision-making. But when you've lived as long as your father and I have, you come to see that the elements surrounding individuals are more predictive of one's route in life than anything else."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Speak for yourself," my father said. "I'm a self-made man. When I was a boy, I walked uphill <I>both</I> ways to skool, through wind and through storm, and I <I>never</I> talked back to my teachers, parents, or other adults!"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Manuchehn," my mother said. "That is <I>not</I> helpful."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Noted, <I>Noor</I>," and Father moved his rook to put me in check. It was possibly the end-game, as my possibilities for escape and/or obstructions were becoming more and more limited.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Well, if nothing else," my mother continued, "just keep in mind, whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        I gasped. "Mom! Are you seriously quoting <I>The Greath Gatsby</I> at me?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        She shrugged and gave me a bewildered expression about why that would be a problem. I looked back at the board and suddenly saw it: I moved the rook and suddenly there was no escape for father.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Checkmate.
