                I asked my father what he thought about god. God. Ahuramazda. Whatever. 
                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                He pulled out a piece of paper from a legal pad near his computer. Then he removed the pen from behind his ear, and drew a large symbol on the sheet.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    “You know what this is?” he asked.
                    <p>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“The square root of negative one,” I said.
                        <p>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Yeah, an imaginary number. It’s impossible to find the square root of a negative number. Because there is no number that you can multiply by itself and end up with a negative number.” He removed a cigarillo from his breast pocket and lipped it. “Multiply two positives, you get a positive. Multiply two negatives, you get a positive.”
                            <p>
                                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“So God is imaginary,” I said. “Got it.”
                             <p>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <p>
                                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy father lit his [cig] with the [combustion device], inhaling and exhaling a cloud of smoke.  “No, it’s not just that. Imaginary numbers might not be impossible, yet they still can help you solve problems.”
                                        <p>
                                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Clever,” I said.
                                            <p>
                                                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFather inhaled his cigarillo again, brightening the intensity of the red cherry at the cylinder’s far end. He exhaled. “But who knows, son? This strange fevered dream that we call existence is beyond reckoning.”
                                                <p>
                                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“So it’s possible,” I said. “God could have crafted the world?”
                                                    <p>
                                                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy father shrugged and tapped his [cig] onto the oversized ashtray atop his work desk, causing the ash to fall. “But who is to say whether or not this demiurge is anything but a demiurge? Powerful? Sure. But all-powerful? Why is that necessary?”
                                                        <p>
                                                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Or all-good?”
                                                            <p>
                                                                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Or all-good. Or omniscient.”
                <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“So… just a creature, prob’ly created themself, who happens to create other creatures.”
                <p>                                             
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy father exhaled smoke. “Why not? Works well enough for mankind and every other living species on the planet.”
