   Mars is a they/them who got their <mark class="mark4">[explicit act redacted]</MARK> by Hector a few moonths ago. But then Hector immediately half-ghosted Mars, before declaring that Ahuramazda deemed he must be unconscious in a glass casket for a few consecutive weeks.
       <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   
       So now <I>I</I>’m sitting in Mars’ parents’ ginormous fully-finished basement (which in itself could house my whole house), watching some horrible sitcom about southern AINROFILAC, as we sit a full meter apart on the plush, leather couch.
       <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
       “You checked on Hector lately?” Mars asks.
       <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
       “No,” I say.
       <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
       Mars shakes their head. “What he’s doing is <I>so bad</I> for his body.”
       <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
       <mark class="mark4">Mars thinking about his body.
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           Mars not thinking about my body. </MARK>
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           “Yeah,” I say.
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           “I’m thinking about going back to [the publik skool].”
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           “Really?”
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           “Something is wrong with the algos. They have us pretending to be pro wrestlers and writing pro-fascist indoctrination manuals for cybernetic penguin slaves.”
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           “You think that’s wrong?”
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
       “The algos punish me if I do math. Yes, I think that’s wrong. Well, any math that’s not Hector’s lunatic prime number factorization trees.”

           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           “The lack of algo’s pushing higher level mathematics <I>does</I> seem problematic,” I say.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
           “It’s not problematic. It’s [suspicious] business.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp		
The upstairs door opened 
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
		A stampede of feet transforming gravitational potential energy into kinetic, sound, and heat energy pummels down the stairs. It’s Mars’ cousin, <mark>Khali Pahlavi</mark>.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
“Oh good, y’all’re clothed,” Khali says. “I was afraid that I’d walk into y’all tangled up in ‘mazdaForsaken positions.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
“Shut up,” Mars says.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
“What?” Khali says. “It’s not that weird of a thing to fear. Xiander’s fairly cute.” Then she looks at me. “In that weird, desperate kind of way.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
“Thanks,” I say.
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
Khali smiles. “You’re welcome.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
“We were just talking about how suspicious [TMB] is. With its algos never recommending we do higher-order mathematics.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
Khali yawns. “Who cares? There’s ten gazillion stars in every galaxy and ten gazillion galaxies in every galaxy cluster.”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
Mars scowls. “What’s <I>that</I> have to do with anything?”
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
Khali laughs. “It has <I>everything</I> to do with <I>anything</I>.
