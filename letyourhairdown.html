	Mars is a they/them who got their <mark class="mark4">[explicit act redacted]</MARK> by Hector a few moonths ago. But then Hector immediately half-ghosted Mars, before declaring that Ahuramazda deemed he must be unconscious in a glass casket for a few consecutive weeks. 
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    
        So now <I>I</I>’m sitting in Mars’ parents’ ginormous fully-finished basement (which in itself could house my whole house), watching some horrible sitcom about southern AINROFILAC, as we sit a full meter apart on the plush, leather couch.
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “You checked on Hector lately?” Mars asks.
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “No,” I say.
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Mars shakes their head. “What he’s doing is <I>so bad</I> for his body.”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        <mark class="mark4">Mars thinking about his body.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Mars not thinking about my body. </MARK>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Yeah,” I say.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “I’m thinking about going back to [the publik skool].”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Really?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “Something is wrong with the algos. They have us pretending to be pro wrestlers and writing pro-fascist indoctrination manuals for cybernetic penguin slaves.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            “You think that’s wrong?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “The algos punish me if I do math. Yes, I think that’s wrong. Well, any math that’s not Hector’s lunatic prime number factorization trees.”
