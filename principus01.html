            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Maybe I made the wrong decision,” [principus] said.
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “What do you mean?” [his wife] said. 
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Maybe it wasn’t the Almighty & Awesome Ahuramazda [AAA] telling me to take this position,” he said. “Maybe the voice I heard nudging me was my own ego. My own pride. My selfish want. Or maybe worse: maybe it was Ahriman Themself.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I don’t think so,” she said. “We communed long and hard about it.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Maybe we were both drawn to something less pure. Maybe it was the material considerations that ultimately swayed us: the better health insurance and the higher pay. Maybe I was just fatigued and worn out by all the disciplinary methods I had to utilize. Feeling unable to do what was necessary to actually transform Higgins without substantial struggle, so I took the easier path. The path more traveled. The climb up the ladder of power. The attempt to be a «big man».”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            He was clearly in one of those moods. Growing up poor and with a distracted father, he had developed an ideology as a youth that he couldn’t quite let go of: the idea that the rich and successful were actually agents of Ahriman. He couldn’t quite believe that [AAA] would want him to model to the downtrodden youth that a black man could rise to a professional status of high acclaim. He couldn’t quite <I>believe</I> that [AAA] would want that for him. 
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            And she was tired of telling that to him. So she sipped her freshly iced, tea-infused water.
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            “Well, you know what I think,” she said.
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            “These kids in BeaverCreek,” he said, “they don’t <I>need</I> me.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            “Don’t let their <I>average</I> [SES] fool you; everybody needs somebody. And don’t give me that rot that they’re all well-off, because I know better.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            He paused and looked at the ground. “Somebody contacted me about a new position. Near Cincinnati. Better pay and better… everything,.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            She nodded. “How much would it affect your commute?”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            “About fifteen minutes more. Each way.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            “Something to consider in your calculations.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            “But doesn’t it feel ridiculous? I’ve only been at BeaverCreek a single year?”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            She shrugged her shoulders. “Have you been communing with [AAA]?”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            “I’ve been trying.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            She set down her glass and leaned forward. “I don’t believe you are meant to be stuck at any particular provincial backwater. I believe you are a man who is destined to rise to a position where you can make vast, great, sweeping changes in how we educate the children of these federated states. And – as we’ve discussed in the past – it seems that an important aspect is you getting a sense of how many different skools operate. From Higgins to the highest paying skools in the state.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            He nodded. 
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	
            “It’s about being better able to heal this broken world.”
               <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
