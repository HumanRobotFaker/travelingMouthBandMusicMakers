    Xiander didn’t want to do anything. Nothing. Nada.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
	He once wanted to do things. He once felt inspired to take part in activities. But no longer. 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
	He just wanted to lay in bed.
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    For three days, he didn’t put in his iContacts™. On day four, the doorbell started ringing.
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “<I>Xiander</I>,” his mother sang, “some classmates are at the door.”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Xiander dragged himself to the front door.

	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Boiled yeshi,” Mars said. “You look like kur.”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “I’ve been sick,” Xiander said.
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “You didn’t report as sick. There’s no biomedical indication that you’re sick.”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Xiander shrugged.
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Are you depressed? Lost in self-absorption?” Mars asked. “Or are you just hitting the Roxxxie™ too hard?”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Shut up.”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “What? These are reasonable questions. You remember what happened to <I>Winfield</I>, don't you?”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Oh, so I’m Winfield?”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Mars shrugged. “First, self-absorbed depression; second, anti-natalist, nihilistic destruction of communal neighbors.”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “By not participating in skool?”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Our rankings are dropping. And the Triple A’s blame you.”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Cry me a river,” and Xiander slammed the door on Mars.

<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	
Mars tapped on Xiander's window. 
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Quit it or I’ll call the police,” he said.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Do it," Mars said, "and TMB will drop you to the truancy council. They’ll put you back in publikskool.” 
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Leave me alone.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Your non-action doesn’t only affect you.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“It doesn’t matter, Mars. None of it matters.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“You’re already here. You made the decision to enroll.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Quit being so dramatic.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Let me in.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“So you can squeeze some points out of me? Squeeze some EPs like I’m a rotting orange?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“You’re ridiculous.”

            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Xiander let Mars inside.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“You don’t even know about the newest eduProjekt,” Mars said.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I don’t care.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“The Kingdom of Antarctica. Apparently, there’s been an overthrow of the egalitarian penguin communist bloc. The Ears that Hear arranged a coalition to invade and install a neo-monarch to rule.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Stop it.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Now a hyper-democracy is being cultivated and they’re selling cardstock titles of different subsects of Antarctic beachfront property. In anticipation of the higher price value. You know, because of global warming.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Quit.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Mars shrugged. “Andrew [Ramblehurst] has got his minions hot-gluing together tiny hats. Exorbitantly ornate, tiny hats.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“That’s fine. It doesn’t matter.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Listen, idiot. I’ll let you record my voice.”

        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
	Mars and Xiander went to the penguin liberation front meeting. It was held at [blank space] and Hector couldn’t stop ranting about the transformative power of lucid dream prayer. 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Everyone needs to write down their dreams. The entire movement. The revolution.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Xiander yawned. “How long should we lay in bed every day? Doing this <I>dream recall</I>, that is.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “No!” Mars yelled. “No beds. The revolution does not occur in bed.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Xiander remembered the lurid tale Hector once told him [regarding Mars & Hector].
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “How is this interesting?” Xiander asked. “They have all the fun stuff. Tiny hats. Fanciful property deeds of beachfront property. <I>Crayon drawings</I>. What do we do?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Hector smiled. “We are psychonauts who explore the inner cosmos.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Never mind him,” Mars said. “He drank that yeshi tea a duodecimal ago.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I mean,” Xiander shrugged. “That sounds interesting enough. But <I>what else?</I> We can’t be a one-trick pony.”

<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Winfield announced that the Triple A’s had instructed him to establish penguin revolutionary skools. Granted, there was not a shred of evidence regarding such algo advice, but Winfield pushed forth and began compiling the curriculum, which we ourselves would make.  
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Hector demanded that the penguins be ceaselessly trained in the art of «prime factorization tree planting».

<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Mars demanded Xiander’s participation in the “discovering” of ancient penguin proletariat spiritual practices. Ones that cast aside transient material aspirations for the development of atmanic fulfillment and mastery. They weathered paper and randomly roughed the edges, before running calligraphy pens across the top, illustrating copious amounts of vague nonsense.
