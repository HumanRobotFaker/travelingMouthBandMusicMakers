                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            At the gathering of the heathens, the trespassees of Ahuramazda's holy decorum drank cheap silver cans of yeefass and threw beanbags at wooden targets painted with the colours of a flag for a long lost legion of slaveowner counter-revolutionaries. <span type = "censored">Uriah's people.</span>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Are you guys playing for States' Rights?" I asked.
                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Huh?" one asked.
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Whuh?" another said.
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Fukk you talkin' 'bout?" a third said.
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I walked away and let them be. A bird landed on a wooden post beside me. I imagined pretending that I was skitzophrenic like Andy, receiving all sorts of occult messages from the bird like «Isosceles triangles are the superiour polyhedral face.» I walked back inside.
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            A group of boys surrounded Hector. One spat all over the floor, pretending to be a bass drum beat. Hector rapped over the beat.

                Some yeshian.
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                In the garage, thankfully, was someone I knew: Winfield Jones. He smoked a cigarette and blew smoke.
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "No surprise that <I>you're</I> here," I said.
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                He laughed. "Right back at you, MarsBar," he said. "You bein' an apostate and all." 
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "I'm not an apostate!" I said.
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "Oh, you can't fool me. You're on the slippery slope now. Give it a month and you'll be a cumguzzlin' iconoclast who eats unpurgated babies in their spare time."
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                My eyes popped out of my head. "<I>Excuse me?!?</I>"
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                He inhaled his cigarello, brightening the cherry red tip, before exhaling a cloud of smoke. "Too much?" he asked. "I'll scale it back." Then he dropped his cigarette onto the concrete floor and stepped on it.
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "You better. I cannot believe you just said that to me."
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "Apologies. My tongue got loose from drinking yeefass. And I didn't 'xpect you here.'
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "Hmm. I s'pose I'll forgive your apology. Half-apology as it is."
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "Who'd you come with? Hector?"
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "Yeah. How'd you know?"
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                He shrugged. "Only common point of contract that I could figure. You drinking? I'm getting another yeefass."
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "Tongue not loose enough? No, I'm not drinking."
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Winfield left the garage and returned back into the house. I stood around, unsure whether I should follow, so I just stood back and stared at the garage's half-finished drywall.
