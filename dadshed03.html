                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        
                    My <mark class="mark3">father</mark></a> smoked filterless cigarillos that he rolled by hand. Usually, he smoked in the living room where he worked, but sometimes he smoked in the garden. In the past, he would sit there and leer at my mother’s arse while she worked. Now, he only smoked out there when she was absent. 
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    She was absent. She’d gone to OrnjSprings to commune with nature.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    A plume of smoke arose over my father’s head. “Are those rhododendrons yours or your mother’s?”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “Mine.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “Science projekt, right? I noticed you’ve intentionally made the soil rocky and poor in quality.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “A student in Nippon designed a CRISPR alteration on certain sections of genes on the fifth pair of chromosomes, which seems to activate protein synthesis that allows increased root formation under suboptimal abiotic conditions. So I’m part of an eduProjekt to ensure it works in all geographic locations.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “A possible aid for autotrophic agriculture in an ever-warming world?” Father said before using the pressure gradient force to increase the combustion rate of his cigarillo. 
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “Sure,” I said. “I mean, it’s not my idea or anything. I’m just following directions [albeit carefully] like blikbloks™. It’s not even something I’m particularly interested in; the algos just <i>told</i> me to do it.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “The automatic algorithmic advisors?”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “The Triple-As, yes.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    He nodded. “My teachers gave us stickers; yours Nyle-drone you supplies and gifts.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “Yours were humans and mine are a series of mysterious machines in Mongolia.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    He took a final inhalation before dropping his cig on the pavers and stepping on it. “I’m sure everything has its pros and cons,” he said, before picking up the extinguished cigarillo and dropping it into the sand-filled metal bucket. “[I’m b]ack to work. Don’t forget to exercise today.”
