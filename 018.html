            Winfield, Uriah, and I helped Hector move all the firstFloorFurniture and prepared for painting. Hector, for all his assets and strengths, was absolutely helpless in some regards. He grew up in a house where things broke and nobody fixed 'em, and messes were made 'fore they were left there for jaars. If jobs were done, they were completed half-arse and without care. Hector was impatient with the proper preparatory process for painting an interiour: cleaning walls, unscrewing outlet covers, removing embedded objects, taping the walls, and laying out the plastic drop «cloths». Applying a couple coats of primer. Hector wanted to just slather on paint and be done with it. He wanted to be finished so he could return to his bedroom to [sleep sixteen hours a day].
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            After we'd moved everything and done all the pre-primer prepWork, Winfield left. "I gotta go babysit Loretta and make sure she doesn't smear her orifice juices all over the place. Or find a sharp corner and do herself in, smashing her forehead into the edge over and over again."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Wow," Uriah said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Don't mind him," I said. "He's just hyperbolic."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Winfield laughed as he exited. "Hardly."
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector biked to the store to buy some extra cleaning rags (and water; his water had suddenly been shut off for unpaid bills, although his mother was upstairs calling over and over again to get it turned back on). This left me with only Uriah. And then Uriah started getting weird :- looking at me intensely, making faces, and then he tried to poke the side of my torso.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I glared at him, stopped what I was doing, and literally waggled my finger at him like he was a bad dog who was trying to hump my leg. "No," I said. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  He shrunk back.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "You may <I>not</I>," I said. "You may <I>not</I> touch my body without my consent. You hear?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            He quietly nodded. He'd probably been <span class="censored">[censored]</span> ever since he saw me in my swimsuit. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "I'm gay," I said. "I don't like boys like that. The thought of that <I>repulses</I> me, okay? So don't get confused. We're friends."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean anything by it."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "But you <I>did</I>," I said. "Don't lie to me. I know what that was about and you know what that was about, so let's not pretend. But <I><U><B>not</u></B></I> interested." And then I took the sandpaper pad and smoothed out the rough caulk someone haphazardly slathered over a nail hole.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Uriah was quiet. He didn't know what to say and I was incensed, so I let him stew in his shame. Eventually, I told him to grab the screwdriver and start prying off the lid of the white primer.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Have you ever dated a girl?" I asked Uriah.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Ummm, not really. I mean, a couple summers ago, this girl kept making me play her husband in some elaborate roleplay game with the neighbourhood kids in her backyard."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Made you?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Yeah, I mean, obviously I could've left but she was really insistent on everything. And I guess I liked the attention." Uriah pried off the lid of the primer, before setting the lid upside down on the plastic dropcloth. "She kept making us go to sleep and wake up so we'd lay down together. And then I kept getting sent off to 'work' with a kiss goodbye." Uriah shrugged. "First kiss."
