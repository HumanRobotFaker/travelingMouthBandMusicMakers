                    The road underneath their feet appeared to float behind them. They rode atop automatic pants, which kicked forward and backward, but all along, Winfield and Hector were in the same place: the center of existence. 
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    “I’ve always known you were special,” Winfield told Hector.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    “Yeah?”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    “Long ago, when we were young, I saw you and there was a dark silhouette that lay beyond you. From another universe. And it twinkled at me.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    Hector laughed at this. After all, even though he would never admit it, Hector sensed that he was one with the godhead and this existence was simply a big joke. A good laugh. A theatre performance put on by a cosmic toddler throwing a blanket over their head.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    “Why are you laughing?” Winfield said. “Don’t try to hide from me.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    “Hide?”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    Winfield smiled with all his teeth. “You’re Yeshi? You’ve emerged from the soil of your own decay, right? The divine flowering angiosperm, shooting seed-laden fruit, to bring on the eternal springtime?”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    “Aren’t you an atheist?” Hector said.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    Winfield shook his head. “That’s all a game. That’s just sudoku. That’s just seeing what button-mashing can unravel supposed civilized adults.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    But Hector didn’t believe him. There was no way that Winfield believed in Ahuramazda. 
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    Winfield nodded his head like he could read his mind. “Yes,” he said. “Yes, Hector, I believe. I am an investigator for the divine groundOfBeing and we’re onto something <I>very big</I>.” He nodded again. “And only you can stop it.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    Hector smiled. He knew this was a lie. <I>This</I> was a game that Winfield was playing. But it was hard for Hector. He wanted it to be true.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    “You have to break reality,” Winfield said. “The system, the machine :– it all needs [to be] unraveled. You have to deep-dive into the dream realm. You have to sleep for a month. You have to find Dr. Dalton in the depths of Kur.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    “Lucid Dream Casket?”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    Winfield nodded. “Lucid Dream Casket.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    The two teenage boys walked through neighbourhood streets, until they ended up on the slightly graveled grass path onto the BeaverCreek YYY [Yeshian Youth Yoke] property. From this elevated path, they could see the dismal reflection on the pond of the low-intensity building lights to their left and the menacing, dark woods to the right. Winfield turned right as if he knew where he was going, so Hector followed.
