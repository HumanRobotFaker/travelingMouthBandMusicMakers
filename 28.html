                “<i>An interview?</i>” the man said, sitting down on a tree stump, holding a mason jar full of a blue liquid. “Like you want to exchange viewpoints as if we’re trading crops?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    
                “Where I attend skool, we’re supposed to interview people that we find interesting.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Ahhh…” the man said. “You want to put me under a viewing lens and poke me with needles.” He took a drink of the blue liquid. “I’d offer you this here drink, but it’s of a particular fermented nature. Has Jeremiah offered you any well-water?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Yes, he has,” Khali lied.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Liar,” the man said. “Jeremiah,” and then he muttered something [vernacular].
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Jeremiah left to the well, hand-pumped up some water, and then returned with a couple of glasses. The translucent water had a reddish tint.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Colour is just iron sentiments,” Jeremiah’s uncle said. “It’s good water.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Just like biking on the highway, I doubted its safety, but I drank the water anyhow. “I just want to ask questions about Ammonites.”

                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The man shook his head. “You don’t even know what my name is.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “What’s your name?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “<i>Immaterial</i>,” he said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Immaterial?” I said. “Why?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Because that’s what my parents named me,” and the man grinned.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Are you serious?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                He nodded. “Words have multiple meanings, ya know?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “So I’m assuming your name doesn’t mean <i>irrelevant</i>?” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Maybe it does. It’s not matter. Beyond matter.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Spiritual,” Khali added.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Jeremiah was back within the fenced garden, grabbing pollen with his fingertips and smearing it on pistils. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “So why do you want to discuss Ammonism with me?” Immaterial said. “I am many things: a man, a blanco, a farmer, an adult… why Ammonism?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Because I know men, blancos, and adults. I don’t know Ammonites.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Jeremiah finished his mason jar of blueberry wine. “Fair enough,” he said, and then he stood up and returned to the house. I tried to follow him, but he said: “I’ll be right back.” A minute later, he returned with a refreshed mason jar of the blue liquid.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “You know it’s ten in the morning, right?” Khali asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Ten?” Immaterial said. “Ten <i>what</i>?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Ten o’clock.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Ten of the clock?” He looked around at the trees and the sky and everything. “I don’t see a clock.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Khali glared at him. “The clock ticks even if you don’t hear it. Cells mitotically divide, particles collide with particles, and terra keeps progressing in its ellipses around the solstar.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Immaterial nodded. “Sounds very profound.” He took another swig of the mason jar. “Okay, boy. Ask your questions.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “My name’s Xiander,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                He laughed. “What kind of name is <i>that</i>?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                I nodded. “And your name is Immaterial.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Correct.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Where were you born?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Somewhere in the wilderness of KANADARIO. My father bred like a rabbit, having eight children with his first wife before she died and then having seven more with his second wife. My mother was the second wife.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Are Ammonites allowed to divorce and remarry?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Every Ammonite gathering™ is different. Some do and some don’t. But every one I’ve known has allowed the widows – both male or female – to remarry.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “So at what point did y’all move to OIHO?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Well there was a schism within our Ammonite gathering™, apparently. I was little when it happened, but it apparently started over something as stupid as [outsiders] demanding the gathering™ install a particular septic system for our [faeces]. Apparently, it was <i>very controversial</i>,” and Immaterial took another drink of his blueberry-fermented liquid.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Khali’s eyes had begun twitching, as she worked on a different EduProjekt. But she still interrupted: “how much of that crunk-juice are you going to drink?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Immaterial grinned. “The future is a mystery,” he said. “But the past indicates it’ll probably be a little over a liter. Whatever it takes to help me fall asleep in the middle of the day. I work nights at a gravel mine down the road.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “You know,” she responded, “there are pills for that.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I’m sure there are,” he said. “There are pills for everything. But I have to <i>buy</i> pills and pay for the doctorVisit and yadda-yadda-yadda. With this, I can make it out of the blueberries I canned last summer.” Then he finished his mason jar and went back inside.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Jeremiah,” Khali called, “your uncle is a sloppy lush.” 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Jeremiah looked up from his manual work of cross-and-self pollinating angiosperms. He responded: “I not know.” Then Khali t-t’d me that this is how Jeremiah responded when he didn’t understand the anglo.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                I t-t’d her: “you hate drunkards, yeah?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Khalied t-t’d back: “scum of the world.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Immanuel returned with a refreshed mason jar of blueberry-tonic. “So anyway, after the gathering™ argued with great animosity about whether updating our strategy for disposing [faeces] was an affront to Ahuramazda, enough of the elder men decided to <i>not</i> update the septic system, setting up a big legal brouhaha with the nearby municipalities. And thus, there was a pro-change group of families that decided to split and move. We <i>wandered</i>, with the adults in charge believing Ahuramazda would lead the way. Those freaks had us walk along carriages pulled by mares for over one thousand kilometers!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “You walked the whole way?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Well, I was a child, so I only walked some of the time. Otherwise I was carried or rode in the back of the wagon nestled up against supplies.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “And from this, y’all ended up in Charm OIHO?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Immaterial nodded and drank.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Why Charm?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Because,” Immaterial said, “as we traveled, one particular individual migrated to a position of total command over the others. And while nominally, that’s not how the offshoot gathering™ worked, as this individual was just one of the elder males, it became clear to my older siblings that this was when he started steering the ship. [And that’s when everything went off the rails.]”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “How so?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Immaterial drank more and sort of swayed as he sat. “That will have to come on another day.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “What was the name of the individual?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Immaterial finished his mason jar. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Balthæzaär,” he said. Then he stood up, stumbled a bit, and wished us goodnight.
