            The speed of light is woefully inadequate for interstellar travel, but just perfect for intraterrestial nigh-instantaneous communication. Who knew where the executives of TMB University were located on the globe? The local kids joked it was on a spaceship nestled at the bottom of the ocean at Oo latitude and Oo longitude, but that didn’t make a whole lot of sense. Nonetheless, when Mister Allen put on the SpaceHelmet™, he was instantaneously on a Himalayan mountain being interviewed by a minion.
            
            “You’re hired,” the minion said.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “I’ll tender my resignation with my current employer,” Mister Allen said.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Did you have an issue with the terms of service?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Not that I can see.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Excellent. Well, to start, you’ll be interviewed by one of your students.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            From a nearby cave entrance, a young [hispanic] boy emerged. He held a microphone. When Mister Allen swiveled his head to look at the minion, he found it gone.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The boy had an old-fashioned cassette tape recorder in hand. He loaded a cassette and pointed the microphone at Mister Allen.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “How do you morally feel about the installation of nanochips into the brains of penguins?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “What?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “For the purposes of increasing communication between the penguins. Do you have any aPriori objection to such meddling with nature?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen swallowed. “For what purpose?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “The purpose matters?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen smirked. “The purpose always matters.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The young boy scrawled some marks in his hand-sized notebook. 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Well,” the boy finally said, pointing the microphone back at Mister Allen. “There are disagreements about the true purpose. Disagreements abut what the sincere purpose is.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen nodded. The cirrus clouds looked so real. “What do <I>you</I> believe the real purpose is? For implanting nanochips into penguin brains?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “I think it is a confluence of factors.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen laughed. “A confluence, huh?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Money, global security, a scientific inquiry into the nature of consciousness itself…”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “How money?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “The development of an adept and obedience workforce whose whole cost is krill and upkeep.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Upkeep.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “And krill.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Well,” Mister Allen said. “I don’t know about all this. But I’ll say this :- folks’ notion of <I>natural</I> is skewed. <I>Everything</I> humans do is natural. If beavers building dams is natural and bird nests are natural, then all human tool-making and meddling is natural.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The next day, Mister Allen showed up to the office at the [empty space] building on the corner of Dayton-Xenia ST and Grange Hall RD in BeaverCreek OIHO to find a veritable parade occurring. Twenty teenagers pedaled floats on modified bicycles, waving bright ornj flags emblazoned with the Antarctica symbol, and tooting horns. 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Welcome! Welcome!” the children sang.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Thank you,” Mister Allen said. “Thank you.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The kids looked at Mister Allen quizzically. “Welcome to the new embassy for the Kingdom of Antarctica.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen watched the children lower the flag for these here federated states and replace it with the Antarctica flag.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Ummm…” Mister Allen said.
