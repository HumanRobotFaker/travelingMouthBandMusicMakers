Through some iContact™ sorcery, the duo caused Mister Allen’s LCDTV screen to creek-stream an AI-assisted live production of their bicycle ride toward Hector’s house. Along the way, factoids and updates flashed across the display, letting Mister Allen know the duo’s current distance to Hector’s house, Hector’s religious background prior to becoming a paid subscriber to Doctor Dalton’s Dream Academy, and the perspective flashed every half deka-second from one iContact™ viewpoint to another, along with slicing in the view from one of the nigh-infinite wiki-cameras located across the municipality. The AI-assisted production suddenly manifested a ticker, announcing the top rated eduProjekts created in the county this week, before transitioning to a Dasanaquafina™ advertisement couched against a replay of a thought texting exchange that Hector had the previous week.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Redhead and Midget arrived at Hector’s residence, a two-story five-bedroom house with half the windows missing blinds, curtains, and/or insect screens. The lawn was plagued with weeds 5 decimeters long, flowering and going to seed. A giant oil stain covered the driveway and acrylic red paint lay splattered on black shingles that lay below Hector’s second floor bedroom window. To reach the front door, the duo had to squeeze through a narrow passageway allotted by the giant overgrown hedgeBushes threatening to swallow the front porch whole.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

The midget turned the front door knob and pushed open the unlocked entryway. The hallway was dark, the walls painted a dingy off-white beige, a pile of shoes on the floor, an ornate clock reading the wrong time, the linoleum floor torn, ripped, cracked, broken, missing… the duo marched forward into the kitchen/eating/family area, finding every horizontal surface covered in clutter. Dirty dishes, fake plants, junk mail, newspapers, advertisement flyers, used disposable cups and cutlery, plastic wrappers, trash — the eating table completely conquered by a pyramid of canned beans, apricots, and pumpkin pie mix. Then, there in the “family” room, a 7 j.o. boy wore a VR headset like an astronaut helmet, turning, spinning, and dipping as he picked up and deposited imaginary blikbloks. A label emerged over the boy indicating that it was {OSCAR}, Hector’s younger half-brother. 

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

The duo turned and headed back to the front staircase. The handrail had been ripped from the wall, but still lay on the carpeted stairs in suggestion that someone was about to fix it any day now. At the top of the stairs, a generic painting of a flower pot was set on the floor, leaning against the wall, covering up a hole kicked in the drywall by Hector’s big brother Brazil nearly a decade before. The duo turned the corner, burst through Hector’s bedroom door, only to find a floor full of dirty clothes.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

{M.E.} :- he moved his bedroom to the basement, you dinguses.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

{A.R.} :- thanx MarsBarCandyStar.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

The redhead turned around and went back downstairs, but the midget lingered, perusing the walls, which Hector had covered either with bright, waxy crayon drawings or passages/dialogues that Hector’d scissored out of a yeshian divine anthology. There were a few new passages that were particularly alarming. It was the Shamshounian tale, and Hector’d highlighted the word <B>DREAM</B>, which is how Shamshoun’s mother learned about her future offspring’s superstrength being contingent on his having uncut hair and an uncut penis. Then Hector had underlined and circled a number of details about the tale’s massMurderSuicide finale. He’d circled and underlined {the Allophyles} and how they made Shamshoun <U>impotent</U>, <U>blind</U>, <U>castrated</U>, <U>weak</U>, and {<U>chain</U>ed} him to the pillar of {their} temple. Then the midget turned around and followed AR (redhead) downstairs, whose location was indicated by a coloured dot on a translucent map of the house.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

The door to the basement remained permanently ajar because the one time ever that Hector went on a family vacation (to Fleuritta), one of the neighborhood kids (a friend of Brazil’s) broke in through a basement window to throw a little party and had kicked in the locked door to the basement. [the external window was replaced by not the internal door]. The basement stairs were grey-painted wood and the air was chaulky from the unfinished drywall and unswept cement floors. There were three “rooms-in-progress”, with functioning electricity, but simply used to store boxes and random, old furniture. Except the back room. It was locked and being used as Hector’s dreamAtorium. Redhead rifled through boxes and containers, looking for a screwdriver or a skinny, pointy objekt.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Redhead found something, stuck it into the door knob orifice, and was able to turn the locking mechanism. Then he quietly opened the door.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

The small room was a complete antithesis from the rest of the house. Immaculately clean, carpeted, newly wallpapered, and an olfactory stimulation diffusion feature. The duo felt as if they had stepped through a portal into a parallel dimension. And, against the wall, surrounded by a plethora of medical equipment, lay Hector Chavez in a glass coffin, raised one meter above the floor.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“This is creepy,” said the midget.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“That’s because it’s sacrilege against the human condition,” redhead said. “It’s tantamount to that anti-natalist claptrap.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“That it was better to not be born?”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“To remain in the shadow realm of ideas. To not be physically incarnate. To not be.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Should we force him awake?”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Redhead shook nay. “We break into his house, jostle him, and somehow he dies? We might end up found liable. Fallacious or no.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“So… what’re we doing here?”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Waiting until he awakes. He has to rouse to the waking world to orally ingest his ‘sleep supplements’.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

So they waited.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

[Hours later.]

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Hector opened his eyes. He smiled. Then he saw red + midget staring over.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Benisons upon ye,” Hector said.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“The realm of the dreamscape is not a parallel dimension but merely and intraconversation,” red said.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Seems like an unscientific hypothesis without experimental viability,” Hector responded.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Hector Chavez,” the midget said. “Commie John from Tempe AZ asks what cerebral phenomena have you just experienced.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Thanks for asking, John,” Hector responded, unsure whether this was a lark (since he was sans iContacts™ and thus couldn’t channel). “I navigated through a myriad maze miasma of subterranean tunnels and caves until I reached the center of the planet, a molten liquid of nickel and cobalt, which sloshed around, creating a magnetic field, with which I became one, able to transverse the vacuum of empty space, forever and ever without end.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Nice,” the midget said. “Wanna hear about my dream last night?”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Sure,” Hector said.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“When I came to, I was in a beautiful, large room and Andrew’s mom was there and I banged her!” Then the midget held up his palm for a high-five from Hector.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Hector scowled.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“You know he doesn’t like that humour,” red [Andrew] said. Then he unsheathed the link of everDecreasing triangular prisms and handed it to Hector.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Woah,” Hector responded. He examined the tiny triangles as they transcended the macroscopic/microscopic barrier. Then Hector tapped one of the largest triangles. “You know, in my vision, it kept going. A triangle bigger than the continent, a triangle  bigger than the world, the stellar system, the galaxy, the universe…”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Pardon my failure to depict that,” red said. “Do you recall when you had that vision?”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Hector rolled his eyes. “Listen, the triangle is mortal, its internal angles are only half the degrees of a circle, <I>unlike</I> tetra-sided shapes like the <I>rectangle</I>.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Red smiled. “That’s <I>correct</I>, Hector. The vision did <I>not</I> occur during one of your antisocial REM safaris, but rather, during a prosocial psychonautic CHOPS™ adventure.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Thus,” the midget added, “creative imagery and novel ideas are not the sole domain of the dream realm, but are also accessible elsewhere.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Hector shook his head and closed his eyes. “What a weak, pathetic conjecture.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“You keep saying that,” red said. “But it’s time to wake up. It’s time to get moving.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Wake up,” the midget said.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“I know Doctor Dalton has convinced you that life is meaningless and without consequence, but I’m telling you he’s wrong. It’s of the utmost consequence. The consequences for our actions and inactions are drastic beyond belief.”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Doctor Dalton doesn’t teach that life is meaningless,” Hector protested. “That’s shree feppel!”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“It’s time to wake up,” the midget said.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Wake up,” red said.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Wake up!” the midget said.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Y’all get out of here! Give me my sleep supplements!”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Red and midget shook their heads.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“We already flushed your drugs,” red said. Which wasn’t true; he’d merely pocketed them.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Hector climbed out of his glass casket and attacked them. Normally, his being a champion wrestler, he might’ve taken them, but the midget wrestled too and red had taken militaryRestraint training, and Hector was famished with muscles recently unaccustomed to any movement whatsoever. So the duo pinned Hector down.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Get the fukk off me!” Hector yelled. “Get the fukk off me!”

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“It’s time to wake up,” the midget said.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

“Wake up, Hector,” red said.

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

Hector wiggled away from the duo and scurried to the door. He fled out and the midget immediately closed and locked the door. The duo were both FalcolnSkouts, so they unpocketed their multiFacets and immediately began disassembling Hector’s glass coffin.

An infographic appeared on the screen. The GreeneCounty score had increased and they rose in the rankings.
