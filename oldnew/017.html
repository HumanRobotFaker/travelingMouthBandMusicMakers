           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector's mother came back home and began hassling him about sleeping 2/3 of the day away. After all, the house was a mess, the lawn was a meter long, full of spikey weeds going to flower, and she wanted all the first floor furniture moved to the basement along with the items off the wall so they could repaint. Everything had to be done <I>immediately</I>, which led to much screaming that made dreaming impossible. So Hector fled and went hiking in OrnjSprings with Khali and me.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Why the rush?" Khali asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Probably something to do with an insurance scheme," Hector said. "Our [water] pipes froze and burst a couple winters ago. My mom probably had some deadline to show progress of work on the house or something that she procrastinated on and forgot about, so now she's hysterical."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "You know," I said, "we can help you."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Khali laughed. "Speak for yourself. He's not <I>my</I> boyfriend."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector looked up quizically.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Besides," Khali continued, "my triple-A, triple-P says it is a poor use of my personal resources."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector laughed. "Slaves to status, slaves to monies, slaves to P-P..."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Khali rolled her eyes. "Being liberated - not that I agree that you are - is <I>not</I> inherently superiour. All sane people are tethered to that which we think serves us best."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector laughed. "You think most people are aware of the strings, cords, and chains that pull them here and there?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "No, of course not," Khali said. "I think most people are insane animals that should be put down with massive injections of anasthesia. That's why I qualified my noun with the modifer <I>sane</I>. And as a sane person, there are pros and cons towards our liberation <I>from</I> and/or surrender <i>to</i> our being LowlySubsets to a HigherSet, and the celestial scale one uses to mass out these pros and cons is a product of one's imagination and wholly subjective."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector laughed. "So there is no objective better or worse?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "It all depends upon one's goal, which is in and of itself a subset of a larger goal. Ad infinitum."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Ad infinitum," Hector said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Ad infinitum," I said. "Check out this vine, you guys. Isn't it pretty?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Khali looked up at it, but continued walking. "It's parasitic and weakens the substrate upon which it climbs. It's an invasive species. It'll grow so big and heavy that it'll eventually bring down the whole tree along with itself."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "But not before it flowers, fruits, and reproducess itself," I add. "A reasonable reproductive strategy. And we're children of immigrants; the idea of «invasive species» is racist."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector laughed. "As if one can't prefer beautiful shady trees over poisonous, ugly, thorny, parasitic hyper-breeders that take over everything."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Khali punched Hector in the shoulder. "Exactly. <I>Prefer</I>. Not better; not worse. <I>Prefer</I>."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Prefer because it's better," Hector said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I shook my head. "Let the record stand that this vine is neither poisonous <I>nor</I> thorn-ridden."
