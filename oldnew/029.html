            When I returned home, the sol was shining, the sky was blue, and the birds sang in the trees. It was as if nothing happened.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            I bicycled over to Hector’s house. It was mid-morning and I hadn’t put in my iContacts™, so there was no warning. When I arrived, it looked as if his mom wasn’t home :- the only vehicle atop the oil stained driveway was his big brother’s dead red SUV. The garage door opener didn’t work [F*D] and even if it did, the garage was too jam-packed with <I>stuff</I> to park any vehicle anyhow. The lawn was exceptionally long and when I knocked, nobody answered.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            So I walked around the back, checking my legs for ticks as I sidestepped overtly spikey and thorn-laden weeds, as tiny creatures danced and buzzed atop the amorphous wilderness which had been allowed to cultivate [(amidst a cornucopia of perfectly maintained houses featuring uniformly mowed and «treated» lawns)]. Around the back, I reached underneath the tiny, dilapidated wooden deck and lifted «the rock amongst a thousand rocks» finding the housekey. Then I risked the rotting deck collapsing underneath me and I let myself in the back door.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            The house was a total disaster. Crumbs all over the floor, mail, magazines, and newspapers piled atop every raised horizontal surface, and a kitchen eating table hoisting up a pyramid of canned food. Everything in disorder and no occupant making any effort whatsoever to reduce the chaos.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Hello?” I called out.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            [silence]
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            I walked to the front hallway, past a mass grave of mismatched shoes, and swung upstairs to Hector’s bedroom. I listened, but heard nothing. I knocked on the door, pushed it open, slowly peeking around the corner to where Hector’s bed was. But he wasn’t there. His room was a mess, but it was always a mess: papers, notebooks, books, cardboard boxes, art supplies, sculptures, [cords and wires], an electronic typewriter, speakers, a projector, pillows, blankets, a desk, a chair, a death shrine. Everything but food, dishes, and dirty clothes — which I’d loudly dissuaded him to not leave around and stink up the room. I sat on his bed, a barely sheeted mattress plopped on the floor and shoved against the corner, and picked up an open spiral notebook next to where he laid his head.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            I scanned the text for names. My name, specifically. Found: <I><U>Mars and Mali [Khali] held hands, telling me they were lovers, and when I said it was incest, they told me the Divine Anthology provides no prohibition, which I knew to be false, but when I went to the section in the [10 000-page book] to find prohibitions about offspring or progenitor’s siblings, the words all smeared and slid into a gradient of density, revealing all sorts of water-coloured landscapes, which made me realize I was dreaming</I></U> […] I flipped through text and saw phantasies about marrying Britni Sheba and raising children with her (post-lucidity). Then I glanced around the room, shuffled through papers and I found lip gloss, hairbands, and other female paraphernalia. Against myself, a pang of jealousy ached my stomach. But knowing Hector, there was no telling how long ago that they were left here.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            I returned to reading his most recent dream journal. I laid back on his bed, smelled only him on the pillow, and read his excessively described dream details until I drifted off to sleep.
