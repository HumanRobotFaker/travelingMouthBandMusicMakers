                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Yeshi, according to the seven state-sanctioned stories [SSSS], hung out with the scum of the terra. The diseased, the criminal, the licentious, the druggards, <I>et cetera.</I> So Hector, a righteous yeshian, followed suit. But, in my opinion, Hector misstepped when he began to join the rabble in their ritualistic CIE [combustion-inhalation-exhalation] of that hindoo flower bud during those social gatherings which they euphemistically called "parties".
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "It helps communion," Hector said. "It's akin to eating meals to build community. Drinking coffee and tea as you communicate."

        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "A kin? An evil twin type of kin?"

        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Ahriman & <span class="text-swap" id="ahuramazda"><span>Ahuramazda</span></span>
            
            ?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Exactly."
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Nah," Hector said. "Weak analogy, MarsBar. Guatama Flower Buds aren't of Ahriman. Blancos only state that because the early adopters in these here federated states were of the dark complected variety."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Or because it makes you a stoned, lazy, zoned-out idiot."
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp And I shouldn't have said this because it set off a landmine that triggered this big ole practiced speech that Hector had been crafting for years.

        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "The alternation of consciousness," he began, "is an implicit element of human existence, one that occurs gradually as we transition from the child mind to the adult mind, and one that happens suddenly on a daily basis when we wake and fall asleep. Furthermore, our consciousness can be altered by substances we intake and/or abstain from intaking, causing fluctuations and shifts in our moods and consequently, subsequently, the stimuli to which we focus changes and <i>how</i> we focus on the aforementioned stimuli changes."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Aforementioned," I said.
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Aforementioned." Hector smiled. "Furthermore," he winked, "intake of psychoactive substances - such as yeast-fouled aqueous solutions [yeefass] - is not prohibited by the most populous subsects of yeshianism and, in fact, is modeled by yeshiHimself™ in five of the quadruple esses [seven state-sanctioned stories]."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I slowly clapped in applause. "You're still breaking the law. And your religion's <i>namesake</i> explicitly told yeshians to obey the law."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "That was situation-specific," Hector said. "And all that is superceded by the fact that one should obey 'mazda law over man law."
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I rolled my eyes. "How convenient."
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Normally, I wouldn't wander with Hector to one of his holy interactions with the heathens. But my father was out of town on a business conference and my mother was permissive with curfew as long as I explicitly detailed my movements and actions via the MOB. Plus, I figured the racist blancos would lay off me since I'd recently ditched the headscarf in solidarity with my sisters in Eurazikka.
