   "Whaddya think happens after we die?" Khali's older brother (Keivan) asked me after cornering me in a guest bedroom at Auntie's house. "You don't believe in that Vahalla+Kur [faeces], do you?"
   <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I don't know," I said. "As far as I know, I've never been dead."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Yeah, but <I>whaddya <B>think</B>?</I>" he said, sitting on the bed.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I...don't...know."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "I think we're just dirt. They put us in the ground and the bugs eat us, the animalcules eat us, and then we're dirt. And that's it."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "You sound very confident of that," I said.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "You think different? You think our magick lil' atman-spook flies off to another realm for which there is absolutely no credible evidence?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "I was just commenting on your assuredness."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "No other theory makes any sense whatsoever."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        I continued standing. "Oh yes. Nothing incredible about the fact that substances mixing around on a giant rock conjure up all these crazy creatures who arguably possess various degress of consciousness. Nothing weird about that."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Consciousness isn't real."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Okay."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Free will is an illusion."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        "Got it. We're all just variables being defined by the values with which we're surrounded. Our actions are merely physical, forced reactions akin to a complex series of magnetic attractions and/or repulsions. The omni-denial of 'sponsibility."
