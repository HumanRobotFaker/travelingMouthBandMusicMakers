                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> took me on a hike in a wooded area called TheNarrows™. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> was helping <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> work on some global eduProjekt, where you explored wooded preserves and attempted to identify every single species extant there. I helped, as we scurried along, stopping here and there, turning over rocks, and witnessing non-chordata scurry every which direction.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   
                “I’ve tried to warn <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Marissa</span> about that Chavez household,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “They all are mentally deranged narcissists.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Not true,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> said. “You told me that <I><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span></I> was an abuser and that he learned to be an abuser through a defense-mechanism developed to deal with his mentally disturbed mother with EmotionallyUnstablePersonalityDisorder. You never said <i>anything</i> about any of <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s brothers.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Anyhow, I’m thinking about following your lead and just becoming a lesbian,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> rolled her eyes.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “By the way,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said, “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>, do you like <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span>’ new hairdo?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                As I noticed at the <B><I>Bounce!™</I></B> show, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> shaved her head at some point.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Looks pretty cool,” I said. “Nice to have short hair in the summer.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Do you think she’ll have a better chance of landing some [redacted]?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> punched her in the shoulder. “That’s <I>not</I> why I did it.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Why’d you do it then?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Because I <i>wanted to</i>, okay?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                No one said anything for a while, as we continued scanning through all the macro-biota within our field of view. “You know what’s crazy to me?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “That people could ever walk through the woods and sense that it’s <i>peaceful</i>. It’s a verifiable bloodbath everywhere you look. Even the trees are competing in economik warfare to try and gobble up all the solstar electromagnetic energy, with total callous disregard to who ends up starving in the shadows.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> shook her head at her cousin. “<i>Obviously</i>, no one who’s normal is thinking about <i>that</i>. They just know it feels better to be out in nature than in these strange artificial environments with ninety-degree angles.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “HungryHungryHeterotrophs devouring all the poor autotrophs and snuffing out their poor, little plantConsciousnesses,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. And then she wound up her leg and kicked an ant hill.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You’re going to be punished in Kur for that,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Sure, sure. And Ereshkigal is going to reward you for all your dutiful acquiescence to the dictates of Manii and his boys.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You act like you know, but you don’t.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I looked at both of them. “Are y’all alright? There’s sort of a venom I’m sensing.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> grinned. “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Marissa</span> tried to take the entrance examination [for TMB]. But she didn’t pass.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    
                        <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> turned to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span>. “For the last time, quit calling me my ::dead:: name.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “Okay,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “I’ll try to remember to call you <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars Bellicose</span>.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “KublaKhan of War,” I added.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                        <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> rolled her eyes at me and t-t’d an [obscene emoji].
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    I looked at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span>. “Your parents were going to allow you to enroll in TMB?”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                        <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> shrugged. “They were noncommittal, but it doesn’t matter anyhow.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “There are ways to train for that examination,” I said.
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                        <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> threw a dismissive hand. “I don’t want to do that. I wasn’t really that committed to the idea.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                        <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> t-t’d me: “yet she’s all pouty face about it.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                        <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> got on her knees and examined some lichens on the exposed tree roots of an oak tree. “You know, when I was little, I used to think lichens were a sign that a tree was diseased and dying.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “Yeah, me too,” I said. “But they’re supposed to be indicators of good air quality.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    “Some species of lichens,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> corrected. “There’s specific species that are sensitive to pollution and their absence could indicate a current air quality problem. It’s similar to going into a creek and only finding certain macrobiotic creatures.”
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                        <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> didn’t say anything in response, but just lightly touched the composite organisms working together as a team.
