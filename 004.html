            I cannot write multiple pages in consecutive sequence about the social gathering of heathens because it fills me with such despair, thinking about these morons. Idiots. Retards. Intellectually impaired. The voluntarily brain dead. Hypointels. Farting up the whole planet 'til we roast to death in our own stench like an unholy Dutch oven. And the solstar radiates incessantly, cooking us all alive. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            The boulder already rolling down the hill, long before I was born. So much momentum and kinetic energy that I have no hope negatively accelerating it. At best, it will squash and deform me.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            But hey! At least Ahuramazda will give us all back massages in the afterlife of Vahalla, if we pray 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 times a day! Won't that be nice?
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Ooooh!" Winfield sang. "Look who's a cynical superlative."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I wrinkled my brow. "Superlative?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Winfield shrugged. "Sure. Why not?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "No por que," Hector echoed from the corner, where his shrine of death resided. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "I just don't understand why you guys wanna hang out with these dregs of humanity."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Look at MarsBar," Winfield laughed. "She wants to sterilize all the undesireables."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Euthanize 'em," Hector said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "That is <I>not</I> what I said," I said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Oh, you can't fool us. We know what you mean," Winfield said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "You are of Pahvlavi blood after all," Hector said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Wants to genocide the dumb-dumbs and replace 'em with genetically-modified cybernetic humanoid workers who telepathically communicate to one another but [whom] she can put on <B>MUTE</B>."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I sighed. "You guys're ridiculous."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "No need to wait," Winfield said. "No need to wait to implement your campaign of fascist horr'r! We can march on down to my house and put a syringe right in Loretta's forehead [àla <I>The Giver</I>]."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "No!" I said. "Don't talk about Loretta that way. She's special."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Why?" Winfield laughed. "Because she's <I>extra</I> dumb?!?!?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Everyone wants two of them and half of everyone else moves around," Hector sang.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Just don't talk about Loretta that way," I said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Winfield began hand-rolling a cigarette while seated on Hector's euphemism of a bed (a barely sheeted mattress plopped on the floor and shoved against the corner). "You wouldn't be so sentimental about my elder sister if you'd spent a thousand days wiping her arse, throwing away her piss diapers, and cleaning up the menstrual blood she smears on the walls. The floors. The furniture." He licked the hay-stuffed paper cylinder he'd rolled, sealing it with his saliva. "Listened to her bellowing all day, every day. Felt her fingernails and teeth rip your skin since you's a lil' child."
