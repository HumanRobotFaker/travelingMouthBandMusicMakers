                As the solstar set, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> left and the AntarcticSkouts (headed by <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew Ramblehurst</span>) returned. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> snapped his fingers and the skouts went to work, lifting up furniture and carrying them down the basement stairs.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Good work, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xu</span>,” he said, slapping my back while adjusting his aviator solglasses. “Now that we’ve incapacitated the religious zealot, we can seize his possessions and utilize his property in service of the Antarctic Kingdom.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh?” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “This is the perfect location to shore up foreign good will and re-educate the misinformed populace of these federated states about the benevolent deeds we bestow upon the penguin species.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh yes,” I said. “I can’t think of a better spot than the center of a random subdivision in the random subUrb that is BeaverCreek OIHO.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> looked away and punched me in the shoulder. Then he thought-texted me a GIF indicating that it was in my best [points] interest to play along. My autoAlgoAdvisors (AAAs) stated likewise, but sometimes I found it hard to care.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The sound of the buzzing and beeping could be heard through the front door. The buzzing flew away [(Doppler Effect)] and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> opened the door to find a small crate of painting supplies.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                He opened it right there on the porch and passed me a jar of spackle with a putty knife. “Go around the first floor, patching every hole or dent on the walls.” And my AAAs said <i>yes, yes, yes!</i>
