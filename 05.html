    <P class="newfont"> In the XYZ room, an animatronic penguin explained to Astronaut Al how the grift worked. But, he
        didn't call it a «grift», of course.</P>

    <P class="newfont"> "Some potentially qualified students have parental guardians who are suspicious of unconvential
        educational methods, and thus require increased levels of persuasive efforts," the penguin said. </P>

    <P class="newfont"> "Okay," Astronaut Al said. </P>

    <P class="newfont"> "One path toward enrollment involves increasing parental buy-in by presenting opportunities for
        established roles that provide minor compensation from certain obscure government programs," the penguin said.
    </P>

    <P class="newfont"> "Okay," Astronaut Al said. </P>

    <P class="newfont"> "So with the potentially qualified student in question, a possible solution is to utilize the
        fact that the household possesses minors with varied, multiple disability diagnosis and an unemployed mother who
        can become designated as a «supplementary home-bound educator» <span class="white-emphasis">(SHE)</span>, which
        enables a minor ¢ompensation." </P>

        <P class="newfont"> "Gotcha," Astronaut Al said. </P>
