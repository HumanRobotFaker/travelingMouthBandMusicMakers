    <P class="newfont"> In the XYZ room, an animatronic penguin explained to <span class="yellowstart">.</span><span class="yellow hoverable" id="al">Astronaut Al</span><span class="yellowend">.</span> how the grift worked. But, he
        didn't call it a «grift», of course.</P>

    <P class="newfont"> "Some potentially qualified students have parental guardians who are suspicious of unconvential
        educational methods, and thus require increased levels of persuasive efforts," the penguin said. </P>

    <P class="newfont"> "Okay," Astronaut Al said. </P>

    <P class="newfont"> "One path toward enrollment involves increasing parental buy-in by presenting opportunities for
        established roles that provide minor compensation from certain obscure government programs," the penguin said.
    </P>

    <P class="newfont"> "Okay," Astronaut Al said. </P>

    <P class="newfont"> "So with the potentially qualified student in question, a possible solution is to utilize the
        fact that the household possesses minors with varied, multiple disability diagnoses and an unemployed mother who
        can become designated as a «supplementary home-bound educator» <span class="white-emphasis">(SHE)</span>, which
        enables a minor ¢ompensation." </P>

        <P class="newfont"> "Gotcha," Astronaut Al said. </P>    

<h1>.051</h1>

<P class="newfont"> "Are you <I>drunk?</I>" <span class="greystart">.</span><span class="grey hoverable" id="winfield">Winfield</span><span class="greyend">.</span> asked. </P>

<P class="newfont">The answer was yes, always yes, but Astronaut Al didn't feel compelled to answer sincerely. He was at [blank space], after all, his place of employment. </P>

<P class="newfont"> "Are you <I>Winfield Jones?</I>" Al asked. </P>

<P class="newfont">"That is my given name, yes," Winfield said. "Are you the scam artist who convinced my mother to deprive me of my constitutionally-granted right to access free-of-¢harge, universal publikEducation?"</P>

<P class="newfont"> "I'm no constitutional expert," Al said. "I was an astronaut, not a lawyer." </P>

<h1>.052</h1>

<P class="newfont">"Why'd you stop being an astronaut?" Winfield asked.</P>

<P class="newfont"> "Well," Al said, "the first time I went up to outerspace, I saw the blue marble and my brain released a flood of emotions that left me gloriously overwhelmed in a spiritual wah-wah-wah effect. Felt a fond kinship with the whole of humanity, a sense of cosmic oneness, and all that."</P>

<P class="newfont"> "Okay," Winfield said.</P>

<P class="newfont">"But the third time was different. I felt nothing. Pedestrian. <I>Mundane.</I> And the fourth time, 'twas the antithesis. The blue marble didn't bring me joy; the blue marble made me feel nauseus. Like opening up the bread drawer to find the pugent stench of mold, making you immediately gag and vomit.  </P>

<P class="newfont"> "Uhh..." </P>

<P class="newfont"> "The land on the earth, all that green gunk, just looked like this mold, that I felt such a strong desire to <I>scrape</I> it all off the rock. To wipe it just <I>clean</I>." </P>

<img src ="images/earthSun2.gif">

<P class="newfont"> Winfield struggled to find words. "That sounds <I>intense</I>." </P>

<P class="newfont"> "Kur yeah it was. I ended up breaking mega¢oin of equipment to cope." Al rubbed the hair on his head. "So, they didn't let me play astronaut anymore. And now I'm here." </P>

<h1>.053</h1>

<P class="newfont"> The next morning, Winfield woke up and told his mother: "I don't know if that guy should be allowed around children." </P>

<P class="newfont"> His mother didn't respond. The pupils within her eyeballs pointed directly at the bigScreen LEDTV, like a magnetic needle toward the terrestial poles. </P>

<P class="newfont"> "He told me that he phantasized about wiping out all life on the continents. Just total misanthropic anti-natalist madness. And they put him in charge of <I>students?</I>"  </P>

<P class="newfont"> His mother's eyelids were locked and glassy, staring at the everchanging stimuli illuminating from the electronically excited diodes. </P>

<P class="newfont"> "I don't know," she finally said. "Just give it a chance. You always hate everything before you've even tried it." </P>
    
    <P class="newfont"> "Mom, I'm not talking about an <I>it</I>. I'm talking about a <I>him</I>. The guy you talked to." </P>

    <P class="newfont"> Winfield's mother turned her head in a slow-motion velocity that indicated she'd taken some extra painkill'ranti'press'nts today. "Doctor <I>Huffman?</I>" she sang. "He is such a brilliant man. You are so lucky to have him as a teacher." </P>

    <P class="newfont"> "Mom, he's not a teacher. He's just a contractor." </P>

    <P class="newfont"> His mother turned her gaze back to the LEDTV, which depicted a man biting into a lemon and making a bitter face. </P>

    <P class="newfont"> She laughed. </P>
