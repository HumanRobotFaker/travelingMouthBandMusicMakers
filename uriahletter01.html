       const text = "Mars Bar, <BR><BR> Greetings from lower Alabama. My mother has called my MOB thirteen times already, curious and worried about my father. Has he done anything erratic yet? Did he take me to Richard and drop me off in the middle of their downtown? Has he taken me into an automobile and driven due west for sixteen straight hours until we are in the west Tejas desert with Hector's big brother, shooting two-liter soda rockets into the heavens, while a giant bunny lays around in an opioid bliss? <BR><BR> No, Mom. Dad is behaving himself. <BR><BR> My mother is the one with the heavy rural accent. Daddy's accent is subtle; Mom's accent is like a lawnmower, so loud that it's impossible to ignore. She should have known that something was wrong with Daddy: he was from old money, aristocratic gentry with numerous cousins and kin and grandparents given ceremonial incestuous awards such as KING OF MARDI GRAS, that goofy pseudo-yeshian holyday, where one celebrates the coming resurrection and revival of yeshi himself, where one celebrates the coming by fasting and refraining from terrestial delights, and what best way to prepare for such a holy month of austerity? What best way other than to get drunk on yeefass, wear bizarre costumes, and engage in hedonistic debauchery in disguised masks? <BR><BR>Anyhow, Daddy was a blue-blood in this bizarre culture, and he eschewed the privileges of breeding with so-and-so's sister-in-law, staying in the custom of only dating «the right kind of people from the right kind of ancestry» by getting with my country bumpkin of a mother. Not that my mother is really a country bumpkin. But she is from the sticks, the rural nowhere of fallow soil outside the black belt, and she can be first in her class, academically, but she still is first in class with a bunch of rednecks, hillbillies, waving that obsolete flag of a failed nation-state long dead and conquered. But she looked through the red flags, saw them with rose-coloured lenses, and thought: wow, it would be nice to actually not worry about money for a change. <BR><BR> But alas, money was still something to worry about. How to maintain the familial relationships that ensure the money continues to flow. That the right professional relationships continue to flourish. How not to anger so-and-so, leading to a cascading dominos of effects, until everything is an absolute mess. And she watched her husband, the father of her two children (of which I am the eldest, in case you don't recall), totally collapse into drunken folly, raising his voice at politic dinners, declaring loudly and proudly all the dirty business that respectable society would prefer to go unspoken. «Yes, yes, Herschel, we know slavery was a basis for our wealth, but we could have long squandered that wealth over the decades since abolition if we weren't truly special people, if we were merely buffoon hacks who happened to stumble into the dominant position on the human heirarchy. Our people are special, Herschel.» But Herschel, my daddy, he'd just laugh and laugh and bang the table with his fist, and order another round of whiskey. <BR><BR> Not that I remember this, of course. <BR><BR> But what I do recall is being six jaars old when my parents divorced. My mother tried to make it respectable, asking Herschel daddy to please leave the house, please live in an apartment nearby. So Daddy rented an apartment against the wishes of his divorce attorney (never leave the family property and be possibly misinterpreted as «abandoning the family»), but little did Mama know that Daddy had rented a SECOND apartment, this one in the hood, in Richard, which was 92% black, many of the population stemming from freed slaves from Affrikka, who were prosperous and happening, until a highway needed to be built (according to the powers), and that highway happened to need to be built <I>right through the heart</I> of the black-skinned downtown, shattering the economic prosperity and symbols of hope. Then zone in some pollution-spewing factories and we've created a fine place for the residents to spend their lives. Crime was horrific and there was no sane reason for my father to rent a second apartment there. Except he thought it was funny (?) to enroll myself into the publik skool system there. So one day, instead of being driven to the hyper-expensive private skool, I was driven and dropped off in front of a century-old crumbling brick building with missing letters on the sign and a potholed parking lot, where I was the only white face around. Except for some of the teachers, of course. <BR><BR> What point was my father trying to make? I think primarily he was simply trying to upset my mother, her desire for bettering herself and her offspring, and daddy, having come from wealth and power (relatively speaking), saw it as a hollow shell, some noise that nauseated him, and he was ready to burn it all to the ground (whilst hoisting a bottle incessantly, of course). And once he stopped trying to impress mother; all kur broke loose. At my new skool, I was pinched, punched, bit, depanted, and shoved into concrete walls. Obviously, the pale, nearly translucent skin that I possess did not go unnoticed by my peers. After a few days of this torture, I refused to go to skool, or at least I tried not to go to skool, but my dad kept dropping me off into the parking lot, and some skool administrator kept shepherding me into the hallway and into my classroom. It took about a week before the private skool - at which I was still enrolled - called my mother to inform her of my reoccuring absences (after many attempts, since my father had digitally changed her contact number in the skool records). Needless to say, whilst this couldn't be considered abuse persay (after all, daddy was taking me to skool and keeping me there all day), the judge knew that this was highly irregular behaviour and - whilst not mentioning it explicitly - probably factored this nonsense into their decision to grant my mother sole custody of the children when the divorced finally processed. <BR><BR> Anyhow, Daddy is joyous these days. <BR><BR> «Is your father dating anyone?» my mother asked on the MOB. <BR><BR> «No,» I said. <BR><BR>«Really?»<BR><BR>«He told me that he has no desire to cohabitate any longer.» <BR><BR> «Whatever works for him,» my mother said. <BR><BR> My mother asked if my father was drinking. «Not in front of me,» I said. But I could smell it on his breath. I heard the ice rattling around in the glass whilst he typed up correspondences in his office. Saw him stumble as he walked. Bounce off the walls. Not that I told my mother any of this, of course. She wouldn't let me come visit then. Or at least, she'd make more noise than I felt like experiencing. <BR><BR> The gulf of mejico is fun to ride atop with a big enough boat. Sailboat. Wind powering it with electromagnetic repulsion (your favourite, I know), as the electromagnetic radiation warms my skin, slathered in zinc-based solscreen, clouds floating overhead, the up and down of the boat colliding with the waves, the objects closer moving faster than the objects afar. I don't know why the experience is so majickal. I know that it is priv-blanco [faeces], but I can understand why my mother - having a taste of this life - didn't want to give it up. <BR><BR> My father lives an austere life, but it's all a shellgame. Obviously, there is money to fall back on. He always has help. He will not end up sleeping on skidrow unless he solely, with determined resolution, <I>chooses</I> to sleep on the curb. But my daddy has given me this tired speech - in rejection of the eco-hippie extremist - where he declares the importance of having warm water, heated winters, air conditioned summers, and how it's nice to not have the stressors aging our skin, cracking our resolve, aging us terribly, and sending us to an early grave. <BR><BR> So it goes. <BR><BR> I'll back back in a couple weeks. Anything of note up north? <BR><BR> Sincerely and dearly, <BR> Uriah Bleu, <BR> subcommander of committee #94875485 of Antarctica. ";
