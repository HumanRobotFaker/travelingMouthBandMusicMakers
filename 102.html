            [@ Cherrywood Café]
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “So, how’s genius skool?” Mr. Parsons asked as he used the edge of his fork to partition off a piece of egg white.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen swallowed his black coffee. “You know how when we first became teachers, we used to think about teaching all the time. We wanted to talk about it all the time. Until he kind of swallows whole all aspects of one’s person?” He dabbed an errant drop of coffee with a napkin. “It’s kind of like that.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mr. Parsons dipped the egg white into a dollop of sriracha hot sauce. Then he ate it. “So what type of thoughts?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Oh, the usual fare: logistics, pragmatic phantasy roleplays, replaying previous conversations, wondering WhatInAhuramazdaHaveIDone I’veMadeATerribleMistake.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Helping a class of kids believe they’re uniquely special whilst the rest of us're unwashed masses who’re subhuman?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Aren’t you a 3-percenter?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “I’m more of a 12-percenter.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen drank more coffee. “Well, anyhow, it’s just unnerving because I’m not exactly sure what I’m s’posed to be doing. I mean, I know I have conferences with parents to sell that their children are doing incredible, amazing, <I>terrific</I> academic projekts that they’d never be able to do in normalSkool. And I’m s’posed to host an open space that can be used for <I>anything</I> basically.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “But no class procedures. No classroom management.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “I mean, no. The algorithms and the iContacts™’re s’posed to do all that. But then some kid tells me that children of a cult leader moved to Xenia recently and now the students are planning to confront them?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “What do you mean, ‘confront them’?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen shrugged. “Light torches and run them off with pitchforks?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Did you notify your supervisor?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Yeah, I mean, I felt scared.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “What [did] your supervisor say?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “My supervisor is an AI robot. It said thanks for the 411.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “You’re shitting me.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen shook his head.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            
            ************
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            
            The Antarctic contingent returned the next day. The redhead with all the medallions waggled a finger at Mister Allen.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “It’s already happened! The spawn of Dalton have captured the heart and mind of Hector Chavez!”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Hector’s name was on Mister Allen’s roster sheet. He lived on 96Pd BorderLine.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “What happened to Hector?” Mister Allen asked.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “It’s horrible!” the midget said. “He just lays in his bed and <I>sleeps</I> all the time!”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “It’s causing our rankings to tank,” the redhead paladin said, pointing to the large screen LCD displaying a ranking for each OIHO county with arrows upward and downward. Greene County was down 0.0876 SP.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “So what’s your plan?” Mister Allen asked them.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Well, the AAAs ‘gest we immediately work to reverse Hector’s productivity tendencies,” the redhead said, handing Mister Allen a ticket.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen looked down at the ticket.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “It’s for the 3D printer,” the redhead said.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen went to the backroom, perused through a paper manual, and realized, yes, one of his responsibilities is to validate and distribute the 3D printing submissions of TMB students. 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Mister Allen returned from the back, holding a spiraling metallic sculpture. It was like a snake, with each end capped with a large triangular prism, connected to a smaller triangular prism that connected to a smaller triangular prism, a progression of diminution until the triangles were so small that they could only be discerned by magnifying lens and microscope. And there, the two strands met. Mister Allen was afraid he would break it when he handed it over.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “What is this?” Mister Allen asked.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Witchcraft,” the midget said. Then he pointed to the LCDTV. “You can watch it here?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Witchcraft?” Mister Allen repeated.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “ElementarySkoolStudents do spelling and spells; we do crafts and witchcraft.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Then the duo left. 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
