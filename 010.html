        Winfield told me that he's just like me; he began questioning this whole Ahuramazda is all-loving, all-knowing, all-powerful theorem back in middleSkool physical science, when the teacher kept emphasizing that all matter interactions were push-pulls of electromagnetic attraction-repulsion, as objects otherwise barrelled forward unimpeded albeit <I>guided</I> by the gravitational warping of the space-time fabric. "That and history class," Winfield said, "with 'mazda buffin' their nails whilst the humans smashed in skulls, screaming in abject despair as the blood poured out of them. As disease ravaged their body. If there's a creator deity akin to 'mazda, I see no QED that this universe is designed with us as the focal point. Maybe a perfunctionary tool, a means to an end. But maybe just an unavoidable byproduct to be sludged off in the intermediatory purification process."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "That's what Hector says," I said. "He said his dream avatar indicated that human beings were merely the scaffold to an immortal machine intelligence."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "But for what purpose does Ahuramazda need <I>that</I>?" Uriah asked.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Who knows?" Winfield said. "Maybe they need corn syrup to sweeten their coffee? Maybe they need a sexbot roboho to incessantly pleasure them. Maybe they need a nuclear bomb to murder an opposing deity. Or, you know, the analogous metaphorical equivalent of the aforementioned."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Ahuramazda's reasoning - if 'mazda even utilizes a mode of rationality to aid their decision-making," I said, "- is beyond the reckoning of our minds, limited by the perceptual capabilities we possess. These capabilities being created and shaped by a crass molecular flesh-based reproductive scheme of codons, proteins, and copy-manufacturing errors in a free-market environment of heterotrophic utter brutality (HUB)."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Uriah smiled. "I don't know <I>what</I> you said, but it sure sounded pretty."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "We have the brains of ants, cosmically speaking," Winfield said. "We, who blindly grope the dirt walls and follow the chemical signals left by our ant brethren, have zero hope in discovering or grasping the meaning behind Ahuramazda's ways.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Is this the all-loving and all-powerful Ahuramazda? Or the half-blind, semi-impotent, broken-brained one?" Uriah asked.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "It doesn't matter," I said. "Our ability to understand is nevertheless insufficient. We are hampered and handicapped by our ROY G BIV, 01101-imprisoned brains."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Winfield exhaled the smoky colloid byproduct of his IEC plant matter. "Ahuramazda is not omni-loving. They love only themselves and - to be clear - not our <I>conception</I> of themselves either."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "I don't think Ahuramazda exists," Uriah said. 
        "It is all just particles colliding into one another and randomly interacting."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Just," I said.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Just," Winfield said.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "What?" Uriah said.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Just," I said. "Just a lil' joke between Winfield and I."
        "Just," Winfield repeated.
