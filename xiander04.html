<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Winfield drove Xiander in his parent’s golden four-door sedan to the [blank space] in east Dayton, a block away from Dayton College.  Old Man Reilly sat on the front porch, drinking his espresso, while a man in a giant pink bunny suit furiously pumped a tire-inflator at the behest of an out-and-out astronaut. 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Good morrow,” Winfield sang to Old Man Reilly.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Salutations,” Old Man Reilly sang back. He shook Xiander’s hand. “Long time, no see, Xiander.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Nice to see you,” Xiander said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Xiander’s been busy breaking the thrust per second ratio record,” Winfield said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Ooooh ‘mazda,” Old Man Reilly said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Not true,” Xiander said. “And besides, it’d be rate, not ratio. Ratio is used when the units are the same.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “You guys stay away from those silver suitcases,” Old Man Reilly said. “And the guatama flower buds while you’re at it.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    In the middle of the street, a water rocket exploded upward and the man in the pink bunny danced.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Who are these characters?” Winfield asked.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Some local characters,” Old Man Reilly said. “Apparently they’re part of some hardcore no-holds-barred pro wrestling league in Xenia.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Xenia ‘Xtreme ‘Xhibition,” Xiander said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “You’ve heard of it?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “They perform in abandoned strip mall parking lots. Usually indoors, but sometimes outside.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “You’ve seen ‘em?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Xiander shook his head. “I don’t watch that [faeces].”

    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Old Man Reilly led us inside and into the basement, which served as the conference room.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Much to Xiander’s surprise, there was a crowd, quietly seated atop rugs and meditation pillows, facing an [ancient] man with a headwrap.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"Your dreams are meaningless noise," the [ancient man] said. Everyone listened quietly. "Some s'pose that dreams have hidden meanings. Ones best uncovered. They are mistaken."
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"There's no meaning?" cried out a voice from the crowd.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The man paused, and then continued. "If one is so inclined, it is not difficult to realize one is dreaming. It just jumps out at you. You examine words and numbers, and they respond by performing impossible tricks. You develop the sneaking suspicion that you can simply <I>rewind</I> reality. And then you do."

<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Is this a cult?” Xiander asked.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“You bet your arse it’s a cult,” Winfield whispered back. This guy is the antagonist for Hector’s Ahuramazda. The lazy prophet, they call him. <I>Sri pHepL</I>.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"When a person achieves lucidity,” the sri continued, “they are immediately tempted with the realization that they can live out any of their sordid phantasies. So many do. And that is the extent of their lucid dreaming."
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<I>So it goes, I suppose,</I> sang the crowd.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The sri smiled. "It is a child thing! To eat all the cookies in the cookie jar! And when mommy isn't watching?"
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The sri laughed.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"But a skillful practitioner, after a good glut or two, settles down to the serious business: the total destruction of the rational self." 
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Hear here, sang the crowd.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"Once one realizes the illusory nature of the dream realm and grows weary of the emptiness of all debauched acts of self-pleasure, one may feel inclined to dismantle the machinery that perpetuates all illusion and desirous self-imprisonment."
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Liberate thyself, sang the crowd.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"Death to the rational self!" Winfield yelled, pumping his fist.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Some folks frowned, but the sri grinned.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"The machinery that continues the illusion is the treadmill. Treadmills, in case you do not know, are moving platforms that compel an animal to walk. «<I>You better walk or you'll fall off!</I>» The platform operates as a result of elastic potential energy, where, if permitted a release, causes work to be done upon another object, yielding movement."
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"Now, some LucidDreamLeaders™ devise elaborate, complicated maneuvers for altering this machinery. Perhaps we can stop the ever-IncreasingElasticPotentialEnergy by impeding the ever-IncreasingElectricalPotentialEnergy? Perhaps we can have the equivalent of large pack animals to reorient the treadmill into a different direction! Perhaps we can remove all the aesthetic and safety PlasticCovers, so we can directly destroy the components of the treadmill. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps."
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, sang the crowd.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"But the solution is much simpler! Simply step off the treadmill."
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The crowd laughs uproariously. They beat their closed fists into their knees and flop over into one another. An individual emanating a particularly pungent odor leaned into Xiander.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Xiander shoved him away.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"The lucid dreamer will be compelled to move! Strong emotions! External actors! In your dream, suddenly, you will need to get to work! But there is a traffic jam in the way! Or you forgot your clothes! Oh no, what if people see you naked?"
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The crowd laughed.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
"But it is a simple matter. Just refuse. Simply refuse. Don't move. Even if they threaten to kill you. Because they cannot kill you. Not in your dream. Not... in.... <I>your</I>.... dream." 
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
In response, everyone stood up and began clapping.
