            Uriah wrote me another letter. 31 37 41 43 47 53 59. I read it and threw it in a drawer. Then I looked in the mirror, and cut off all my hair. Then I shaved it bald with a razor. When I went downstairs to show my parents, my mother dropped the casserole dish and it shattered.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            My mother began sobbing as she cleaned up the fragments.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Noor," my dad said. "Come on. She's a teenager."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            My little brother came into the room and screamed. "Does Mars have [runaway mitosis]?" he cried.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I ran and embraced him. "No, no, no," I said. "I just did it because I felt like it. I'm not sick."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "You're not sick?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "I'm perfectly healthy."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            My mother dumped the contents of the dust bin into the refuse bin. "Perfectly healthy."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Why is mom crying?" my brother asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "It's just something mothers do when their daughter cuts off all their hair," my father spoke from the couch. "I've seen it before and I'm sure I'll see it again."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Apparently I cut off my bangs when I was three jaars old.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "<I>Thanks</I>, Manuchehn," my mother said, putting away the broom in the cookie closet. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            My father shrugged and returned to reading his book. My brother rubbed my head and ooh-awwed over the feeling of the texture. My mother left the room.

            "You look like a space alien," Winfield said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Did you have a spiritual revelation?" Andrew asked. "Did Manii arrive in a dream and command you to dispossess yourself of all accoutrements?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Then Winfield sent me a nasty [t-t] :- <I>did you shave <b>everywhere?</b></I>
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I muted Winfield and looked at Andrew. "Actually, it was the founder of TMB. He said I should shave my head and let you paint me blue so I could play an alien for your stupid MCW [faeces]."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            And soon as the words went out, the Triple-A's all went <B><I>DING-DING-DING</I></B>, and like Pavlov's Cur, the boys had no choice but to [follow it]. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Uriah Bleu sat with his back against the wall. He looked shrunken and repulsed.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Okay, okay, okay," Andrew said, "no need to reinvent the wheel :- this alien is going to bring KingLeroy the two-sided polygon, but, you know, it's less about the payoff and more about the build-up. We'll do it like the one 'zine we found in Xu's dad's shed, <span class = "emphasis">THE ALLIANCE</span>, we will tease out Mars' arrival for multiple moon cycles with some beacon of light, right? Electromagnetic radiation that is [coded] like a radio wave, full of hidden information that Antarctic scientists take weeks to unravel."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Slowly leaking little tidbits," Winfield said. "To keep up the tension."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "But we'll film Mars in the meantime," Andrew said, "because we have no idea if she'll keep her hair short."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I looked at Uriah, against the wall. "What do you think, Uriah?" I asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            He looked out at nothing, only momentarily making eye contact with me, before returning his gaze forward. "Glad to have you aboard, Mars."
