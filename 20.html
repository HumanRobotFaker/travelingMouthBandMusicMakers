                Dear <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>,
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I heard your mom put you in the looney bin. Apparently that’s a possibility when you try to put yourself permanently into a lucid dream state whilst laying in a glass casket. How’s it going in there? Are you continuing your experiments in there? Any divine insights you care to proclaim from your explorations?
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Cordially, <BR>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander Xu</span>
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp —----------------------------------------------
                
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">XX</span>,
                
                        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  When my mum arrived home, she thought I was dead. She thought I was in a coma from an accidental drug-overdose, not a scientifically pre-planned one. It probably didn’t help that, once she shook me awake, I told her I was Ahuramazda, destroyer of planets. Or that I told the hospital people my long-winded narrative [of] how, in my dream marathon, it got to a point where the veracity of any person’s statement could be challenged and they were existentially-bound to provide you a number. Then you had to determine whether the number was a composite or a prime, and dream characters would challenge your calculations in humorous ways. I probably laughed too loud when I told a tale [about] how Tripolinite™ tried to convince me that nine was neither prime nor composite b/c nine is just nine ones laid out in a grid and if you multiply one by itself nine times, it’s just one! So 9=1! As if 1*9 = 19. Probably only worthy of a five-minute uninterrupted laugh if you’re certifiably insane.
                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am not allowed to lucid dream in here. Now, that’s impossible for them to actually enforce, obviously, as – even if they possessed EEG machines (which they don’t) – there are no proven reliable patterns yet to be discovered to differentiate between a regular REM dreamer and a lucid REM dreamer. So they simply interrogate, rifle through my writings, and I bore them to death with long-winded rollercoaster anxiety dreams, where I’m just pulled forward on a conveyor belt by external circumstances, bounced around like a gaseous molecule trapped inside a container. When I do inevitably stumble into lucidity, I assure them that I do nothing, but simply wait for the natural tensions of the dream, which the angels crafted to pull me in whatever direction Ahuramazda desires.
                                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy therapist here, Dr. Z (he’s not a doctor), is the only person halfway capable of discussing dreams with me. Theoretically, considering this institution couldn’t exist without gov’t funding, this place should be secular considering the first axiom of human fundamental rights, but this place very much propagates a subsect of yeshianism that – although undeclared – can be identified by the use of ParticularProperNouns unused by other subsects. This subsect happens to view my subsect [EUB] as anathema, an abhorrent form of yeshianism that is actually from the freezing cold plains of Kur, carefully designed by AngraMainyaThemself. So this therapist likes to tell me how (#1) dreams are a communication from Ahuramazda, (#2) to artificially meddle with these dreams is to reject ‘mazda and trust in our own self-selected wayward path rather than the one provided by Ahuramazda. “So what about all those people who make ZERO EFFORT to remember their dreams? Are they not worse than lucid dreamers who – to become consistent lucid dreamers – must diligently work to remember and record their dreams?”
                                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy therapist simply labels these questions as “WhatAboutisms™” and throws them in the rubbish can. S’posedly Ahuramazda has a point-rubric especially designed for every individual. I only compete with my hypothetical ideal self (whoever <i>that</i> is).
                                        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnyhow, I gotta go to GroupTherapy now. Write back immediately, please. Even if it’s only a paragraph. And please encourage others.
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     Sincerely, <BR>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>
                
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp P.S. Don’t write anything about sex, drugs, or violence. It will get seized.
                
                        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp —----------------------------------------------
                
                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>,
                
                                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In case you didn’t hear, part of your mom’s freak out (before she found you upstairs, unconscious in a glass casket) was probably related to the fact that she undoubtedly entered a house that was radically transformed (i.e. it looked like all the furniture had been stolen, when it was simply shoved in that little crawl space in your basement that lies directly underneath the living room adjacent to the garage). What happened was that <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">[Andrew] Ramblehurst</span> – knowing what was going on due to your iContact™ creekstreaming – immediately invaded your house and set it up as the offshore de facto palace of the Kingdom of Antarctica. I s’pose I could’ve woke you up and told you, but honestly I didn’t figure you’d care because <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> and company were basically using TMB funds to <i>improve</i> your house, fixing stuff up, re-painting, et cetera. But sorry if that contributed to your imprisonment there.
                                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Mars says she/they is/are not gonna write you, but wanted to communicate that she/they “told you so, you stupid idiot.”
                                        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Most of what you’re missing right now is this silly Antarctica game that seems to have taken over everything. I’m not wearing my iContacts™ right now (they’re “charging”), so I can tell you that the girls (<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span>, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span>, Paola, & Sol) are majorly pissed because they believe the whole concept desensitizes us to the very real suffering of individuals/humans in less geopolitikally advantageous locations ~ this whole, ha-ha laughing about the ecological destruction of the terra, subjugation of autochthons, isn’t it funny the fancy words that autocratic totalitarians use to describe the murder and torture of millions?
                                            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlso, the algos are doing weird stuff like trying to get us to infiltrate publikskools and cause a student-democr’tic movement. I’m pretty sure it’s just TMB trying to stir up chaos so they can expand their market share of FS tax dollars allocated for the education of non-adults.
                                                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut whatever! TMB keeps NyleDroning us the toys, so we keep dancing and playing!
                                                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnyhow, hope you’re doing well. Are they respecting your vegan diet?
                
                                                        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   ~ <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">XIANDER</span> ~
                
               <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp —----------------------------------------------
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">XX</span>, 
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis facility is apparently stuck in the medieval times, thinking every meal centers around a big hunk of meat and that vegetables are only fit for consumption if marinated in beef broth for [a terra rotation] and covered with melted cheese. They attempted to slap me with an eating disorder before I raised a fury about have the FLFS sue them for denying my ability to practice my religion (while not all EUB practitioners are vegan, my vegan philosophy derives from my temple’s subsect emphasis on environmental stewardship, which is hindered by the so-called animalHusbandryIndustries). They relented and now I have salad with uncut blocks of unflavoured bean curd for every meal. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI see the girls’ arguments for being against the Antarctica dealio, but I’m not sure if loss-of-empathy is a predetermined result. After all, is it worse than what happens in publikskools? There, the adults simply refuse to discuss the issue for fear of losing their professional licenses due to anti-partisanIndoctrination laws that’re written so vaguely you could drive a transPacifik cargoship thru it. I don’t know. I prefer the Antarctica route, but the roleplay-consistency aspects of the algorithm making it <i>undesirable</i> to break character about the whole business is troublesome. But I don’t know – it doesn’t take <i>that much</i> effort to simply find a niche in the game where one can insert their <i>actual</i> thoughts. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> wrote me that he’d started a penguin liberation front. That seems like a fine place to communicate genuine outrage about the trajectory of planet terra. 
               <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It seems that it’s most likely that I’ll be stuck here for three lunar rotations. That’s what a few of the inmates, who speak with great confidence, say. Apparently if one is on [the poverty gov’t medical plan], there’s a three lunar rotation maximum to the “housing benefits”, so I’ll be most likely jettisoned by then (unless I’m a real psycho, then one gets transferred somewhere near Lake Erielhonan).
               <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I’ve been without any sort of interweb technology here for a while now. And I know it’s a cliché thing to say, but it’s sort of nice not having any choice in that regard. I mean, if it was <i>forever</i>, I’d freak out, but knowing it’s temporary, that it’s a vacation, I really enjoy it. It’s been interesting doing things like reading the DivineAnthology without being able to instantly channel twenty-thousand other people’s interpretations and reacts. I’m stuck considering my own thoughts, trying to figure out the meaning, and contemplating ideas whilst being fully aware that they might be total [...].
