           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Why you mess with those phony AI bots?" Hector asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "You think Dr. Dalton doesn't employ bots?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Hector looked seriously at me "No. In fact, they make an explicit point that they're omni-human."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I laughed. "Omni-human."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            He frowned. "It sounds like your advisor contracted an ITD of the sri pHepL sort."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "You see sri pHepL everywhere."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Well, that's because it <I>is</I> everywhere."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "It."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Sri pHepL is more than a person. It is an ideology whose perpetuation is supported by <I>its</I> support for allowing the omni-denial of 'sponsibility for human actions, whilst simultaneously paving the transit corridor toward an AI-dominated, human subservient future."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I nodded.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector had a bnch fo decommissioned books from various bibliotheques splayed out upon his bedroom floor. Pieces and pages were torn, sliced, and scissored, as Hector restructured the fragments into alien juxtapositions.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Such violence," I said, "tearing up artifacts of the past like that."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Reproductions," he said. "Not like I'm disfiguring the originals."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Okay."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "My mother is half-Lithuanian," Hector said. "Her mother, my nana from Boston MA, was a second-generation immigrant whose parents came off the boat when they were adolescents, later meeting as they slaved away together at a shoeFactory whilst living in geoproximity near each other in barely distinguishable shanties by the traintracks south of the city."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            My triple-A already told me this information long ago, but I was curious why Hector suddenly brought it up. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "A lot of my facial features that people ascribe to my mejicano inheritance, but much of it is easternEuropa genetics," me said. "Are any of these people alive?" I asked, pretending not to know.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "My nana lives in Boston still, as does my Aunt's family - my mom only has one sister - but neither of my nana's parents are alive. Her mom died seven dekajaars ago, and the dad's response was to abandon the children to an orphanage."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "How old was she?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Eleven."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Oh my. I'm seeing a pattern."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Hector grinned, scissoring out another old fashioned video camera out of an old catalogue. "My mom hasn't abandoned us to an orphanage. She - usually - keeps the bills paid enough to prevent disconnection of services."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I kept my mouth shut.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "She knows how to play the fed'ralgov't FreeMonies game. With dad's deathInsurance, disability, and all that."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "<I>Where is</I> your mom?" I asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            He shrugged his shoulders.
