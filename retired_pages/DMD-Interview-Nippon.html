                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Mister Douglas, how did you appropriate the moniker that is DEAD MAN DOUGLAS?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U>  A promoter in an Appalachian circuit liked the way it sounded. But he told me he got the idea because I used to work as a <s>prison guard</s> correction officer in a <s>prison</s> detention facility, specifically spending a lot of time in the corridor designated for men waiting to receive execution.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> What is execution?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> Where an employee of the state gov’t is legally allowed to kill a prisoner. There is a big sprawling process, where stacks of papers get passed around from gov’t desk to gov’t desk, before the Lead Executive feels comfortable enough to allow a particular prisoner to be executed.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Have you ever executed someone?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> No. For a while, my Applachian circuit promoted me as an executioner and I wore a medieval black mask, but, no, I never served as an executioner. But I did kill a few guys in [eurazikka]. I used to never talk about that, but I had a [post-traumatic stress disorder] specialist insist it was important to talk about it.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Do you want to talk about it in detail right now?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> Kur no! (laughs)
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> When did you quit being a <s>prison guard</s> corrections officer and become a pro’Rassler?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> A [human being] I knew once took me to his primo’s show in El Paso [TEJAS]. I really didn’t want to go, but he paid for the tickets and promised me as many beers as I wanted. So after the show, he took me backstage to meet his primo and everyone, and the promoter started sizing me up like a potential racing horse for his stable, because, you know, my size. They offered me a slot as a jobber and I was drunk, so I said yes. I had nothing going on at the time. My girlfriend had just dumped me.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Why do you think fans latch onto you?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> You know, the first answer is <i>who knows?</i> I have theories, of course. My character is not that interesting: I say a few catch phrases, I make a point to connect with the common man’s anguish at being ridiculed and demasculinized by people with more money, more education, more beauty, more <i>whatever</i> – or, you know, demasculinized by people who fetishize the better endowed. And, you know, that helps, but I really think it’s all about the dance. Rasslin’ is like a dance, a freestyle improvisational dance, and there’s an irrational aesthetic to the whole business. It’s like my current girlfriend – she’s a great masseuse, but she’s not trained or certified or anything. But she’s given me <i>so many massages</I>, listening to the sounds I make when she tries out different moves with her hands, and now she knows how to make me feel great once she starts massaging my neck, shoulders, back, arms, legs, and the whole bit. She can’t <i>explain how</i> she knows; she just does. And I feel I do something similar on stage, between the ropes. A little pause here, a little headshake, a little signal to get the crowd anticipating what big thing is about to happen…
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> And now you’re under contract with the FWF. 
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> Making more money than I could’ve ever imagined. 
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Now you’re touring our nation [of Nippon] in hopes of challenging Akira Kawachinofumi for the unified World Title. Although, it is reported that he was unimpressed by your non-victory in the Four Corners bout last week in the Fukui Prefecture.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> How can I stop a psychopath from using a crowbar against the skull of a referee?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Nonetheless, it is also reported that you are utilizing this time to explore different aspects of Nipponese culture.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> Are you about to ask me about Dr. Yoo?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Is that okay? How did you end up in one of his notorious, clandestine laboratories?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> Look, I didn’t even know who Dr. Yoo was when I visited. On this tour, I don’t have time to look up every attraction in every little town that I have to work. So, like many people, I hire a company to organize and schedule my recreational explorations. So, one moment I’m seeing an ancient [non-yeshian] temple, then I’m shaking hands with some faceless municipal politician, and then I’m on a roller coaster surrounded with stuffed animals. Right before Dr. Yoo’s laboratory, I visited a botanical garden by a beautiful pond constructed by [monakhos]. It was the most amazing place I’ve ever seen and I don’t remember the name. Then I’m suddenly driven into a scientific laboratory to look at wires, dials, and circuits passing electricity back and forth. I didn’t know what the kur was going on. Dr. Yoo seemed nice enough, but I can’t imagine that I called him the “real deal”.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> But you immediately called the Executive Leader of your Federated States about the visit?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> James Vincenze is a friend of mine. In my head, I <i>know</i> he’s the executive leader – I mean, that’s why I called him – but I wouldn’t have just called <i>any</i> executive leader. I called him because we’re friends and I knew that he was having some issues with a new electromagnetic wave range technology interfering with the wavelength frequency range that spaceships use. I just thought it might be helpful for [Vincenza]. And I know he’s receptive to ideas more so than a normal politician.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> So you weren’t aware that Dr. Yoo is a criminal fugitive, operating chemical science without a license?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> Of course not. I’m a [redacted] proRassler with eighteen recorded concussions. I don’t know anything.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Were you aware that Nipponese authorities attempted to locate Dr. Yoo’s mobile lab after your visit?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> Yeah, I’ve been up to my ears with news about Dr. Yoo. Everyone just keeps telling me about it. Apparently, Dr. Yoo’s gang of horr’rists designed the whole scheme to gain attention. As soon as I left, they probably disassembled the whole place and went down underground tunnels or something.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Did you know that Dr. Yoo didn’t actually invent the extrardimensional wave transmitter?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> If I hear correctly, he stole it from his student and took credit?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Who later committed suicide. S’posedly.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> <a href="pdf/TheAlliance.TMB.Zine.pdf">But I’ve heard that Dr. Yoo has done real stuff on his own. My understanding – and I’m no biologist obviously – is that he manipulated some protein from bacteria to basically use it like a programmable nanobot that can edit the DNA of livestock to make them salivate more. And not just salivate more, but salivate a molecule that absorbs neurochemical wave activity in a weird manner that causes [deconstructive wave interference] that blocks people from retaining memories of a supernatural nature.</a>
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Wait. Where did you hear that?
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Dead Man Douglas:</B></U> Well, one of my new tour guides. After the whole Yoo debacle, I hired a new company for my recreational explorations.
                      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <B><U> Interviewer:</B></U> Mr. Douglas. I think you should start planning your own recreational explorations.
