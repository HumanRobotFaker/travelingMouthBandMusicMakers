                Of course, the next time I’m in Antarctica, they’re talking economik-policy (i.e. “maximum-point acquisition”). How can the Kingdom obtain the most stuff possible?
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Geez, Louise, I thought.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “We could increase the number of municeps with voting powers,” I suggested. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew el Generalissimo</span>. scowled. “And dilute our own power?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No way,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Then what ideas you got?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> adjusted himself. “Well, we could assemble a bot farm.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Isn’t that what the AAAs and all the apps already are?” I asked. “Augmentation to give us the strength of a dozen men?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Sure. But what can give us an advantage over our other competitors at Traveling Mouth Band University? Give us a bigger slice of the pie?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Ah! Yeshi’s Boiled Meat!” I cursed. “Is my Dad hiding behind the curtains?” (there were new curtains) “You been talking with him?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said. “But we did get this anonymous communication,” and he revealed a folded up piece of paper with ransom letters from cutout magazines and newspaper headlines that’d been photocopied to read:-- <i>TMB points are tethered to # of enrolled students; lower others’ projekt eVals and indirectly increase the value of yours.</i>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “We traced the barely visible yellow ID code to the XeniaPublikBiblio,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said. “Figured it was you.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It was my dad. You guys don’t want to do anything he suggests. That bastard lives in our backyard shed for ‘mazda’s sake.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Ad hominem,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> swatted with his hand. “We’ve done a little research. And we brought in an outside consultant.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The doorbell rang and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> answered it. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah Bleu</span> emerged, albeit he wore a bright red suit with pearl white dress shoes and he wore thick, box-framed glasses through which his skyblue eyes peaked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Let me introduce myself,” he said, his southern drawl replaced with a dutch-like flavoured accent akin to the SouthAffrikkan colonizers. “I am Vladimir Vuchovich, a communist rabblerouser at publikEducation centers, who operates under the moniker, <i>Commie John</i>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Nice to meet you, Commie John,” we all said in unison.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Firstly, I just want to announce that our progress in establishing a pro-democracy sentiment has been successful and we’re waiting half-a-lunar-cycle before we establish the adversarial counter-narrative: the idea that the students are too stupid to run their own skool and that notions of democracy and a free market of ideas are inferior to an adultocracy that dictates the market based upon state mandates crafted by experts.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And you suppose this insult will spur the students to overthrow their oppressors?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “We plan day-by-day according to the moment’s circumstances,” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span></s> Commie John said. “But yes, that is the direction we seek to accelerate the needle.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> asked: “What have you found about point-distribution in Traveling Mouth Band University as a result of your investigations?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well, one aspect has become apparent: the algos are now appreciating the contributions of <i>non</i>-TMBstudents to our eduProjekts, but only under very specific criteria:-- that we accumulate specific student identification numbers and tax dollar distribution patterns around the particular student.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Wait, what?” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Commie John shrugged. “The AAAs [autoAlgoAdvisors] made it clear once we started working with <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span>’s friend, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said, “my original response was to accumulate as much of this info on publikskool students as possible. But then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> and Ur–err Commie John came out with a novel idea during a <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brainstorm">brainstorm session</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It was <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah Bleu</span> and I,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said. He threw a dismissive hand at <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span></s> Commie John in his bright red suit and box-framed glasses. “You see, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span>’s from Alabama, where they have these ultra-bizarre homeSkool laws that stem from a bygone era when homeSkool was essentially illegal, so all these maniac yeshians created these fake privateSkools nakedly called ‘coverSkools’. And so what parents did is they’d enroll their kids at the skool and pay fifty bux, be given a student identification number, and the coverSkool would spit out any report card the parents told them to.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So you pay fifty bux, and you get a student ID number supposedly tethered to a student,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<i>Some</i> coverSkools charge fifty bux,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said. “Some charge nothing at all.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And that’ll work? The algos’ll go for it?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span>, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span>, and <s>Ur</s> Commie John smiled back. “It already has,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said. “We’ve been investing in fungible products so our liquidity doesn’t look too outrageous.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So wait, these fakeSkool’Bama’Bots, how do you use them ‘xactly?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “We invent them and then have them create garbage contributions to <i>other’s</i> eduProjekts, utilizing a shoddy content-creator app.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Once someone figures out what’s going on,” I said, “prepare to meet some blowback.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh, we already are,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said. “The Antarctic Cyber Defence Corps [ACDC] are already all ready for likeminded copycat attacks on the academic integrity of our <i>own</i> eduProjekts.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I shook my head. “If I cared more, I’d flee this scene. Bad times are upon us.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<i>But first!</i>” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> and the others all opened up cans of <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="bouncing-ad">Diet Citrus Drop</span>. “<i>Good times!</i>” and everyone lifted up cans to drink.
