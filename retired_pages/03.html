                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> never intended to receive his whole supply from the LunarEmporium; diversification was the name of the game in all formats as far as TMB seemed to be concerned. Most of <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s sleeping chemicals derived from a friend of a friend’s adopted sister who was finishing up pharmacologySkool and in the past “suffered from insomnia”.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The glass casket was quickly assembled by <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew Ramblehurst</span> and his league of AntarcticSkouts (which included  <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah Bleu</span>). Then they returned to their work of assembling a hiking trail to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob Rum</span>’s <a href="GardenOfGods.html"> garden of the gods</a>, which rested at an ignored plot of land near where BeaverCreekTownship and XeniaTownship overlapped.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> laid in the glass casket, which had been lightly cushioned and pillowed, and tried to get comfortable. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsEid</span>, who had juvenile diabetes and thus was comfortable with needles, attached a [sterile] port to one of <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s accessible veins, and then made sure the IV drip bag operated properly. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsEid</span> didn’t “attend” TMB, but she could’ve if she wasn’t so convinced that it was a neo-fascist skull-measuring enterprise from the depths of Kur. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Triple check these figures,” she said to me, passing over a sheet of calculations. I looked at them and then independently verified them with pen-and-paper, because we’d left our iContacts<sup>TM</sup> “charging” in the other room because we assumed this whole activity to be highly illegal (operating medicine without a medical license).
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Looks right to me,” I said. “I got the same numbers.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                She looked down at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>, who was smiling up at her.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You’re an idiot,” she said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Thank you so much,” he said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                She attached the EEG stickers and then the EKG stickers to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>, while I verified the monitors. Then she touched his cheek softly. “Sweet dreams.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                He closed his eyes and went to sleep. I quietly closed the lid of the casket, perforated with breathing holes.
