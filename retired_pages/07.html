            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        
                That early afternoon, I sat in the passenger seat while <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk Schminski</span> drove over a hundred kilometers an hour (approx 30 m/s) in his pickupTruck down rural roads. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> sat in the back with a couple of unnamed cretins who kept emptying aluminum cans of cheap yeast-water before passing them to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span>, who passed them to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span>, who chucked them out the window into nonresidential wooded areas. The back windows were broken and wouldn’t roll down.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You want me to throw a <i>revolution?</i>” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk </span> said to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span>. “Why in ‘mazda’s name would I do that?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well you <i>know</i> Antarctica has resources to bestow incentives upon you,'' <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said. “Think about that high-quality <i>leroy’s luchadores</i> singlet and warm-ups I got for us. There’s more where that came from.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I <i>am</i> thinking about that,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk </span> said, hurling another empty [can] out the window. “And I’m thinking about how I want to be [folkstyle] state champion this year.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well throw the revolution after that.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yeah, but I wanna be state champ <i>next year</i> too.” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk </span> dramatically slowed down and we all Newton1stLawed forward, with the unbuckled cretin bashing into the front seats. Then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk </span> turned right. “And you’re talkin’ all nonchalant about over-throwing <i>skool</i>. Yeah, the teachers are bozos, but that [stuff] is backed by <i>the State</i>, by the gov’t, the police, the military…”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It used to be,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said. “But that’s all changing now.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                One cretin belched. “Man, I am <i>fucked up!</i>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk </span> smiled and spun around his head for a second. “Yeah? <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hurley-id">Hurley </span>, you’re such a slosh.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The other cretin chimed in. “He’s gotta drink away his troubles and forget how I fucked his mom last night.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Everyone guffawed, even me, at the absurdity of it all.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I don’t know,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk </span> continued, looking back at the road. “I don’t know, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span>. I mean, I can <i>help</i> you, but I’m not leading [it]. And even so, I still expect you to wine-and-dine me.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> nodded. “We got plenty of resources to help secure your support.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                One of the cretins asked. “Do y’all got that Roxxxie1.000™? I’d throw a revolution for ten minutes with her!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Before <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> could lean back and affirm that <i>yes, we do, actually</i>, the other cretin said: “Ten minutes? My mom said it was twenty seconds!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk </span> punched the ceiling. “She called you a two-thrustBust!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Ha ha Ha Ah hA Ha ha HA aH Ha.
