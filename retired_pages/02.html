                The procedures [(for attempting Dr. Dalton’s perpetual dive into the dream realm)] were easily accessible on the interwebs, if one took the effort to procure the equipment and chemicals for the task at hand. Luckily, we were biking distance from Senor de la Luna’s Lunar Emporium, an outpost for scientific activity that was largely subsidized by <a href =newspaperhell.html> Traveling Mouth Band University </a>, of which we were all “students”. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> was there, per usual, [fooling] around with a circular configuration of magnets that he’d liberated from the motors and speakers of trashed electronics.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> hovered his head over a stretch of magnets that’d be epoxied to the floor with their north poles upward. “MagLevTrain?” he asked.
                 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “MagLevTrain,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> responded.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “The kids’ll love that,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> said. “Electromagnetism is like magick.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Life is magick,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> said. “Why do you request [the sleeping chemical compound]?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>  handed him a paper-copy of the supposed scientific inquiry on hand. It declared an interest in somatic cell shedding of incessantly sleeping organisms in contrast to their normally sleeping counterparts. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> turned the page and suddenly sang, “Woooaaahhh…”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “That’s <i>a lot</i> of reptiles. Are you sure you don’t want to start with something more modest?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> shrugged. “Sample size is everything.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah </span>
                    interrupted. “How does [the sleeping chemical compound] work? I mean, biochemically?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span>  took out a pen and began writing on a piece of paper. “You know how red blood cells carry a hemoglobin protein that is the perfect shape to hold an oxygen molecule?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Umm… yeah?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah </span> said. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="yeshi-scene">For yeshi's meat</span>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, punching <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah </span> in the shoulder.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Ow!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah </span> cried.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> continued, “if a similarly shaped molecule – like carbon monoxide, for example – gets in there first, then the oxygen molecule is blocked out. It’s like that, except it’s in the brain and this molecule blocks up the port that <i>would</i> accept the natural molecule that would spur an animal awake.” He set down his pen. “Speaking of which: the mass of these laboratory reptiles just happens to add up to 75 kilograms, which could be the mass of any of you given teenagers.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, “it’s against the TMB bylaws to utilize drugs in human experimentation.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<i>Exactly</i>,” he said. “And I have liability to worry about. I’m only authorizing and distributing for a <i>quarter</i> of this sample size.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “But <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span>!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> cried. “That sort of sample size won’t be taken seriously by peer review.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                And then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> laughed. And he laughed. And then Yeshi appeared, smiling on the top of the industrial freezer against the northern wall.
