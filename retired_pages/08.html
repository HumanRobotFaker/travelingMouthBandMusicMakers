                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk </span> took us to a “party”, where a dozen white dudes stood around drinking cheap cans of yeast-water while looking at their [MOBs] trying to figure out where the next “party” was @.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                One of the backseat cretins [<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hurley-id">Hurley</span>] was too drunk to look at his MOB. He kept trying to offer me [y-w]. After a number of <i>no thanks</i>, he began trying to lure me to the garage to smoke some guatama flower buds.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Nah,” I said. “I don’t like it.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You tried it?” he asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yep,” I lied.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What’s not to like? It makes you calm, you get the giggles, food tastes great, and you get like totally absorbed in video games or musick.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “That’s not how it was for me. I got paranoid, felt uncomfortable not busying myself with something, and just felt so awful I went to sleep.” Which is a synopsis of a number of experience-testimonies™ I read on the interwebs. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You lie,” [<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hurley-id">Hurley</span>] said. “You never tried [expletive]. You a yeshian or something?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No,” I said, getting uncomfortable with his sudden aggression. “Yeshi is overrated and wasn’t as unique as everyone claims he was.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “FaireyTale bullshit.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Uh huh,” I said. “Anyhow, can I tell you something about guatama flower buds?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Dude, you’re not about to claim it supports horr’rism, are you?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No,” I said. [Although any black market activity can (possibly) support horrific acts.] “Do you know where the original comes from?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “[Central Continental Autochthons].”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Right. The plant used to be a lot different; they ate and smoked it for religious ceremonies and it was <i>way less powerful</i> than current strands are now. But then euroColonizers took it and started breeding it, like, you know, how we bred dogs from wolves. Or jungle fowl to be egg-laying machines euphemized to be chickens. And now guatama is nothing like it used to be – a seed-ridden flower bud full of thick stems with mild psychotropic effects. Now it’s like cotton candy. Or milk chocolate. And the high shoots you out of a cannon at 30 meters a second.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                That’s ‘cause white people are <i>awesome!</i>” [<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hurley-id">Hurley</span>] sang, reaching up for a high-five.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I gave him a tepid high-five. “Most of my best friends are blancos,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Naturally, this is the moment <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield Jones</span> showed up and some [expletive] hilljack hollered that my “brother” was here (b/c <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>’s mom is of east Azian descent).
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                But <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> had brought a lil’ surprise:-- he had his older sister, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span>, in tow, tethered to a leash attached to a leather harness that wrapped around her torso. Within a second or so, any onlooker couldn’t fail to notice her permanently closed eyes and relaxed mouth from which a string of drool always hung.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Ummmm…”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What the [expletive]...”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Dude, no.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Dude, that’s just wrong.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> clung to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>’s elbow as he marched down the main corridor. I channeled <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> and saw him thought-text <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> to meet him at his [pindrop]. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> arrived.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob Rums</span>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> began, “I was approached by your direct supervisor, <i>el generalissimo</i>, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew Ramblehurst</span>, carte-blanche leader of the OIHO territories, about joining your contingent and pledging my allegiance to the illustrious Kingdom of Antarctica. So I was pondering this offer as I took my elder sister on her weekly walk through the wetlands ,when a solburst through the clouds suddenly interrupted my train of thoughts. And as the electromagnetic radiation warmed my [dermal layers], I came to the sudden realization that AhuraMazdaThemself beseeched me to reject this offer, for I’ve come to believe that the natural nature is superiour to human, artificial modifications. Thus, your kingdom’s campaign to turn penguins into <i>cyborgs</i> is repulsive and must be stopped by any means necessary. Therefore, I am throwing all my time and effort toward the assassination of KingLeroyThe85th, predominately by joining the ranks of the notorious and the infamous Penguin Liberation Front!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Everyone in the room just stared.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “The <i>who?</i>” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> finally said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “The clandestine rebellion of ordinary penguins and their LosAngelesCalifornia supporters to destroy the fascist-hyperCapitalistik regime of KingLeroy,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. “They’re literally in Antarctica, out in the suburbs of the south pole, plotting acts of horr’r at this very moment.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> scratched his head. “That sounds made up.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> began gnawing at her hand. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> swatted her wrist and she stopped.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Fine,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. “Ignore the siren calls of the revolution. But Antarctica will not allow itself to be besmirched by greedy industrialists. The penguin rebellion is upon us!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> threw up a closed fist salute and exited out the front door with his monstrously [retarded] older sister.
