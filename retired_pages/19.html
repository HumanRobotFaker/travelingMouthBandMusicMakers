                “What number did you get?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> asked me at the Lunar Emporium.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Three,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Impressive,” she said. “Shadow number 720.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “What are the odds?” I said. Then I thought about the stack of playing cards. “I believe the odds were 1 out of 40.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “1 out of 38,” she said. “They don’t let people get a number one or a number 2160.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                I sat on the couch, my eyeball pupils twitching every which way, putting together this DeepFake of Prince-o’-pull Cox that I projected to the LCDTV hanging on the wall. The dataset was too small, so the DeepFake wasn’t convincing, but <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said it was better that way. “Realism is overrated,” he said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Somewhere behind us, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob Rums</span> hot-glued magnets down to plywood. One after another, in a straight line, for the magick train that would levitate off the ground.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “My number originally was fifteen, but if you go through the solidification ceremony, you get to pick your own number,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> said. “Now I’m sixty.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I’m 432,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said. “I just thought it was the coolest number of the set.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> said, turning her head backward. “What number are you?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Oh, I don’t know,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">de la Luna</span> responded. “It was a long time ago.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> turned back toward the LCDTV, where Prince-o’-pull Cox pointed menacingly at the pseudo-camera. “I bet you were a 4 or a 540. That’s why we’re all here today.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Why do you think that?” I asked. “What do those numbers mean?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “The numbers don’t <I>mean</I> anything in isolation,” she said. “They only mean anything <i>together</i>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> laughed loudly from across the room. “Don’t mean to be mean, but it don’t mean <i>anything!</i>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “So why 4 or 540?” I asked again.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Because if you take everyone’s smaller number, multiply them all together, and you get 2160, then you’ve got a special group.” Then she started pointing: “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">You</span>’re 3, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span>’s shadow is 5, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">my</span> shadow is 36, and if either of <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span>’s numbers are 4, then that makes 2160. What number did <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> draw?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “He refused,” I said. “He got all weird at times. He wouldn’t dip his hands in the heated hemisphere of water either.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Probably a pseudo-atheist,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Pseudo?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Yeah, you know, if they <i>truly</i> didn’t believe, then they wouldn’t have any problem just doing the rituals.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> laughed. “I don’t think that’s it.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “What do you think it is then?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I’m sorry, ma’am, but that’s top secret information integral to Antarctica’s National Security.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                On the LCDTV screen, Principal Cox said: “Spare the rod; spoil the child!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> turned to me. “Are you writing his speech?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Not really,” I said. “I’m deferring to an AI, which spits out something called ‘predictions’ and I either validate or deny them.” And I [selected] validate.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Children are to be seen, not heard,” LCDTV Cox said. I [selected] deny.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “So you operant condition it,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> said. “Like a rat.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Basically.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> returned to her handmade propaganda art pieces, furiously coloring on small lineless index cards, covering every white space, before running it through the emporium’s plastic laminator machine. Then she handed me a card. It read: <i>“I am not ruled by rules made by rulers.”</i>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Pretty good,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                LCDTV Cox said, “I hereby reintroduce the act of spanking as a means of correction for the disruly child.” I [selected] validate.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The bell atop the door jingled. In walked that white-shoed red-suited mirage known as Commie John, who seemed to be played by <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah Bleu</span> in box-framed glasses.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Greetings <i>comrade</i>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> and I all called.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Greetings vanguard,” Commie John responded. “I am happy to announce that we have received our seed monies to begin the penguin pro ‘rasslin’ league.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “We’re going to have penguins wrestling?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Well, no,” Commie John responded. “That would be inhumane. But we will have <i>humans</i> wrestling for the <i>entertainment</i> of penguins.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> asked: “So penguins enjoy pro ‘rasslin’?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Well, not normal penguins,” Commie John. “But penguins who’ve been upgraded via installation of iContacts™ latest brain chip – they <i><b>love</b></i> pro ‘rasslin’. And is it so bad that they like to watch a few episodes of MondayLunarMadness™ before they go to sleep inbetween a couple of fourteen-hour workdays?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Sure, that sounds reasonable,” I said. “But if they have the FansWrestlingFederation and MondayLunarMadness, why do they need whatever you’re going to do with the seed monies?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Because,” Commie John said, “we’re going to bring the entertainment <i>live</i> to the penguins’ workplaces!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                And then a tiny Yeshi showed up on LCDTV Cox's shoulders and Yeshi smiled.
