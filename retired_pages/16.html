                “You know why she’s razzing you, right?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, as we stood in his backyard. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Because she’s a bully?” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> laughed. “She likes you. Or at least, she’s jealous of you pining for her cousin. She’s like the kid who keeps pulling the hair of the girl he likes. She’s pulling your hair to get you to pay attention to her.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I looked over to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>’s monstrous older sister, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span>, whose torso is strapped with a harness that is tethered to a pole hammered into the ground. “That’s an interesting theory you have,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Just calling it how I see it,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. “You can take it or leave it.” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> stepped on a shovel and stabbed it into the grassy earth. He pulled the shovel blade out of the earth, repositioned it, and then stomped it back into the earth. He repeated this maneuver a few times until he’d made a full circle, and then he started using the shovel like a lever to pry up the soil and break it into manageable chunks.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I held my shovel in the ready position. “Where do you want me to dig?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “There’s fine,” he said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I stabbed the shovel into the earth and started working like <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>. We ripped off the turf of grass atop the soil and sunk our shovels into the soil. He T-T’ed me a GIF indicating how it would go: that we’d dig two holes and then connect those holes to make a large trench. So I followed his directions. While working, I looked over at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> after she made a loud, audible <i>noise</i> and saw her belly-down on the lawn, mouthing some grass blades.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You think she’d be better off euthanized?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Wait? <I>What?</I>” I said. Sweat dripped off my brow, as I kept working.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It’s okay. I used to think it too. Used to have all sorts of phantasies about all the freedom and happiness my family would experience if someone would just jab a syringe into <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span>’s neck and make her go <i>night-night</i> forever.” (dig dig dig dig dig) “But then I started getting to know other people’s families and realized what a load of [animal faeces] that is.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                As I dug deeper, the hole started shaping to a single point, like a V. To take out substantial amounts of soil with the shovel, I had to stand at awkward positions around the edge of the hole I’d created, stabbing into the adjacent sides attached to the vertices.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You think families are inherently unhappy?” I asked. “I mean, I know mine is, but MarsBar’s family seems pretty happy.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> stopped digging. “You mean that culty, happy,  <i>‘WE TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING’</i> Manii vibe? I mean, they do a pretty good job, but it’s all a facade. They <i>don’t</i> tell one another everything. And if the gender-trajectory app is making correct predictions, they’re about to have a firestorm once MarsBars begins painting on mustaches.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                We continued digging. My hole was getting deep enough that I could climb in. That I’d <i>have to</i> climb in, if I wanted to dig further.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I don’t think the world should euthanize people like <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span>. I’m just not used to humans acting like her, that’s all. She seems more like a strange dog.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<i>Why</i> don’t you think we should euthanize people like <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span>?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                We kept digging. I saw that <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> was starting to extend his hole in my direction. Then he hopped into the hole and started working from inside there.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It’s a slippery slope,” I said, starting to focus my shovel on the wall of the hole that pointed toward <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>. “Once you start euthanizing one group of people, where does it stop? There’s probably always justification to kill someone for the ‘good of society’.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So that’s the only reason? The slippery slope that leads to individuals that you deem not worthy of euthanasia?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No,” I said, annoyed. I already felt tired from digging this little hole and my hands hurt and my muscles were beginning to ache. “Just because it was the first rationale I mentioned doesn’t mean it is the supreme reason.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> laughed. “Pardon me, <i>monsieur</i>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I mean, why would you even want to euthanize her? Because she makes people uncomfortable?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh, I don’t know, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>; how about she gobbles up an inordinate amount of resources to keep her alive, to stop her from being dangerous, and it’s generally disgusting and off-putting for most people to have to caretake for her, considering her teenage diapers full of [faeces] and menses and the fact that she’ll randomly scratch, bite, smear [faeces] on everything, if she’s not just drooling slobber all over the place.” Then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> lifted up his shovel and stabbed the edge of his wall and made it dramatically collapse into the hole.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And you blame her for your parents not being happy?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I <i>did</i> blame her. In the <i>past</i>. But, I mean, look at your parents: the only retard they have to deal with is <i>you</i>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “My father is cruel and abusive,” I said. “He views my mother as having inferior intellect, so he uses all these psychological mind games to manipulate her. To further justify her having an inferior intellect that permits him to perpetuate psychological mind games to manipulate her. Ad infinitum.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<i>But he <B>chose</B> her</i>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Look, I don't know what the kur goes on in his mind. You think he tells me?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “But back to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span>. She’s such a drain on resources and such a hassle to keep alive. Wouldn’t it be better to just call in a doctor and commit quietus?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well, you tell me. You’re her brother. What redeeming qualities should render her unfit for such a procedure? You’re the defence lawyer. Whaddya got?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> stopped digging and leaned his chin on the handle of the shovel he held with both hands. “Well, I used to obsess about all the resources. But then I thought about the insane amount of land and resources our society wastes to keep <i>cows</i> alive. The insane amount of pollution we tolerate just so we can eat meat and have lactation-derived products. And frankly, lately, I’ve come to see that <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> provides a unique perspective, which I realize is ironic since she has no eyeballs.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Wait, what?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “She has no eyeballs. She just has these raisin-sized white masses; that’s why her eyes never open.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No, not that,” and the visual <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> transmitted to me made me shudder. You said that we should keep her alive since we keep cows alive. And while cows give us the material for foodstuffs, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> gives us a unique outlook on life?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I don’t know. The monstrous fragility of it all. The hilarious little nodes of pleasure,” and then he reached out of his hole and plucked a couple blades of grass. He put one in his mouth and offered the other to me.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I held it, hesitated, and then put it in my mouth.The flavour was bitter and the texture felt like serrated sandpaper. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> continued digging. “Plus, it’s an interesting data point for me. What happens when I drag <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> around in public. How does this stimuli cause individuals to recoil? How can I analyze this information and further extrapolate it for my own benefit?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                And eventually, finally, our shovels met a common wall of dirt and made it collapse.
                 <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
