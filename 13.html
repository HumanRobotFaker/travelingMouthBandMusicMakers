                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> stopped by KingLeroy’s mansion to check <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s vitals, roll him to avoid bedsores, and empty his piss canisters. His 3-ring binder elucidating his subcerebral adventures grew to novella length. Naturally, like a creepy male cur, I stalked her.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You know <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s mom’s gonna flip when she comes home and sees what you’ve done to her house,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “We haven’t messed with <i>any</i> of her stuff,” I said. “It’s all still here. And <i>nobody’s</i> been in her bedroom. We literally screwed in that giant plywood portrait of King Leroy [over her door] to ensure that.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Y’all’re delusional. She’s gonna call the cops. Especially when she finds her son drugged unconscious in a glass casket.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “The police? Nah. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> told us she’s a prostitute. Prostitutes don’t call the police.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “He said she was <i>like a prostitute</i>; she’s not an actual prostitute, hooking on the street, addicted to the guat’, working for a pimp. She meets up with men from the interwebs, gets them invested enough that they’ll lend her monies or help pay bills, and possibly/probably has sex with them. There’s a difference.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Is there?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “There is. One’s not afraid to call the police on all y’all fools.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “But <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> says she cheats the gov’t out of disability benefits.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “She’s not running some scam, where she’s a doctor pretending to have eighty disability patients they ghost-treat,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span> said. “She’s <i>a patient</i>, one with legit medical records, and self-reported ailments that’re probably [animal Faeces], but which’re difficult to prove as outright fraudulent. She’s not afraid to call the local police, keyword being <i>local</i> not <i>federal</i>.” 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “How do you know all this?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Because for a time, I was interested in uncovering the enigma that is <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector David Chavez</span>. And if you don’t think one’s features and foibles stem from the family, you’re fooling yourself.”
