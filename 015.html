            Andrew didn't <I>actually</I> care about the depletion of phosphorus resources. #1, he didn't actually believe the situation was as dire as the doomsayers predicted ("isn't there phosphorus to mine [planet] Ares?"). #2, he simply didn't see the prospect of mass starvation and a bottleneck scenario of human depopulation to be that terribly troubling. "I mean, <I>we'll</I> be fine," he said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "You're sick," I told him.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "I mean, it's like global warming," he said. "Bad for people in the hot-hot areas, but good for people like us who have plenty of underground aqueous reserves, and whose formerly temperate weather is not capable of hosting multiple agricultural seasons."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Ummm," Winfield said. "You need phosphorus for the basics of agriculture. Photosynthesis. ATP. That's sort of the root of the whole problem."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Which reminded me of something I once read my dad write when I was snooping through his digital archives on an old forgotten laptop :- <B><I>it's possible that human beings are like bacteria cultured in a petri dish that eat and eat, and slowly build up their population, until suddenly BOOM they explode exponentially, and choke on their own [faeces].</I></B>
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Listen," Andrew said, "my understanding is that it is <I>far from certain</I> that we're actually running out of phosphorus anytime in the forseeable future. Extraction techniques improve all the time. And anyhow, it doesn't really matter. None of it matters."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "It doesn't matter?" I said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Not to speak for Andrew," Winfield said. "But if we're anything, we're the scaffold to artificial-machine intelligence. And all good scaffolds come down someday."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Metaphor-metawhore, I thought.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Andrew began blathering about the stars. Still in the burlap sack, barefoot and frazzle-haired, he spoke of how each square degree of the nightsky, how each pinkynail held at arm's length contains <span class = "text-swap" id= "10megaStars">10 megaStars</span></span>, about all the galaxies, all the galaxy clusters, all the inhabitable rocks flying in straight lines on [gravitationally] distorted space, warming and molding little heterotrophic monsters who crumble and dissolve upon the slightest little change in surroundings. "Phosphorus," he laughed. "Society's gonna collapse because of fukkin' <i>phosophorus</i>," and then laughed and laughed, banging his fist against the floor, as Winfield grinned, and Uriah twisted his fake mustache.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Andrew stopped laughing. "Phosphorus. How many protons is that again?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Fifteen," I said. "With no phosphorus, there's no adenosine triphosphate, which means the cell organelles cannot do their work against the concentration gradient. In heterotrophic <I>and</I> autotrophic cells."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Well," Andrew said, "it sounds important. Somebody start funneling those new nuclear fusion reactors so their mondoEnergy can help 3D print some alchemy. Just put some oxygen and nitrogen together and we're all good. Right, Professor Eid?"
