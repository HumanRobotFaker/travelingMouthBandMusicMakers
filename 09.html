                Back at the AntarcticOutpost, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> had a giant laminated poster of <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>’s head that he’d printed at the LunarEmporium, and he secured it to the wall so he could draw on him with dry erase markers. I went upstairs to make sure <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> was alive (still alive; still sleeping), but found that the printer had spilled out some pages of dream recall during a momentary bout of consciousness. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> had his iContact™ on OFFLINE mode, but bluToothMicrowave capability still allowed him to send thought-texts to the printer. I shuffled the pages in order, hole-punched them, and put ‘em in the 3-ring binder as instructed.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Downstairs, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> discussed orchestrating a drone strike against <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>’s residence, whose satellite photo was illuminated upon the LCDTV screen.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “Hey! Not funny. My uncle died in a drone strike,” I lied.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “My condolences,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said. “My second cousin died when a piano fell on his head,” and then he went to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s [formerly] out-of-tune piano and played a few notes.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I’m not sure how seriously we should take this matter,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said. “Or with how much urgency. Our intelligence indicates that <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> pulled this whole thing out of his hind end.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “But what if our intelligence is wrong?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said. “What if we don’t know? I mean, how do you know what you don’t know? Maybe there are LAcelebrities hiding in basements around VolkstokStation, hosting secret meetings to convince penguins to stop shaving their legs and spending monies buying a different tiny hat everyday of the week!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “But no!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> cried. “We <i>need</i> that tiny hat revenue.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                “I know,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said. “Exactly.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                But then I had to go home because my mom was beeping me.
