                Around four in the morning, when half of <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s living room wall was covered in crayon drawings, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span>’s AAAs pushed him to suggest we foment a democratic revolution amongst the hypointel students at the BeaverCreek EduCational Center.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Why in Kur would we do that?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Destabilization, primarily.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “For lulz?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “To increase the number of potential skouts to serve the Antarctic Kingdom,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said, taping up a new crayon drawing. “Hard to get them working for us when they’re incarcerated [7x180=] 1,260 hours a year.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I went upstairs to check on <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> (alive; asleep) and came back down to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob Rums</span> microwaving his iContactTM stream onto the LCDTV.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Who’s that?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Harold Cox,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span>  said. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> was 150 centimeters tall, had blueish-white skin, and a head full of tightly bound blonde curly locks. “The new head principal of the BeaverCreek EduCation Center.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “According to Antarctic Intelligence Agencies,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> said, “Mr. Cox attained his newfound position as the result of his past success and his connection with several BeaverCreek SkoolBo’rd members that attend his non-sectarian yeshian temple off of FS-35 in east Dayton.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It’s not what you know, but whom ya know; am I right?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What <i>we</i> know,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> continued, “is that he has a particularly narcissistic authoritarian style that involves imposing a whole bunch of new rules and regulations, while self-congratulating himself multiple times a day during what has been termed 15-minute PublicAddressSystem [sermons].”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So he’s sowing discontent amongst the normie population who just want to chew gum, watch BoobTubeTM, and space out on InfiniSpace while teachers label them ‘burgeoning proficient’ just to pass them along,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Sounds like the <i>perfect</i> revolutionary proletariat class of warriors,” I laugh. “Do we have a leader or leaders of this lumpenproletariat?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span> blinked. “We have some candidates.”
