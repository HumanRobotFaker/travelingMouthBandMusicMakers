                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span>’s cousin, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali Pahlavi</span>, wasn’t bothered by the skull-measuring of TMB like <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> was. “You see how your buddies are trying to promote democracy?” she thought-texted me. “A quote from Einstein about the freedom required for plants to grow! You think these subconsciousHumanoids care about <i>that?</i>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I t-t’ed back: “I see you’ve been tasked with promoting the royalist variable of this equation.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Theoretically! Hard to have a counterrevolution without a potent revolution.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Why do ya think TMB’s algos are pushing this?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Why’re you sniffing around my cousin’s arse like a horny cur ready to hump a couch cushion? She’s already told you that she’s forsworn males due to their congenital condition of having a preposterous profundity of gametes. ‘No’ means ‘no’, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I haven’t done <i>anything!</i>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yeah, but I can surmise what sordid ideas foment inside your mind. Your heart rate timeline tells the whole tale. See <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Marissa</span>? BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! You’re basically a stalker rapist creepin’ ‘round waiting for an opportunity of weakness to pounce.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Boiled Yeshi!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Anyhow, we’re having a gathering of counter-revolutionary loyalists at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Marissa</span>’s house. Since her parent’s don’t know you, you have to eat dinner with them beforehand. If, you know, you want a chance to come over and steal <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Marissa</span>’s panties when no one’s looking.”
            
               <h3><center> ** > ---------------- < ** </h3></center>
               <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Marissa</span>’s house was a kilometer from <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s, but in a subdivision hosting much more spacious homes. Theirs from the outside was intensely landscaped (no lawn) and the interior was immaculately clean with purposeful decorations that looked expensive. Dinner was full of vegetables, with one or two to represent every colour of the rainbow. The dishes and cutlery were heavy. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span>’s parents were dressed in well-fitting clothes that appeared new and flattering.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>,” Ms. Eid said, “our niece <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> took the liberty of printing out your TMB resumé.” She unfolded a sheet of paper pulled from an envelope. “It appears that you’re quite involved in robotics?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I hoped <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> had only included my animatronic penguins, rather than emphasizing that claptrap about my being a sexbot mod specialist and repair person.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh yes,” I said. “Well, my dad is a computer programmer, so this sort of activity runs in the family.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Mr. Eid spoke. “So <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>, that comment provokes for me a long-established query about the human condition: – do you think we are programmed by our genetics to do the activities we do?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well,” I said, knowing a salient answer involved personal responsibility coupled with empathy for patterns that seemed to have a genetic component. “Genetic expression occurs in response to particular chemicals, causing some proteins to be assembled from a chain of amino acids based on copied codons. On some level, these actions – the growth and maintenance of our bodies – clearly are beyond our control. But the idea that the totality of our behaviour is tethered to chromosomal patterns seems unfounded and, frankly, rooted in simple-minded logical metaphors that conflate the human organism to a computer. We are <i>not</i> merely computers, even if there are similarities.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So you take personal responsibility for your activities with robots?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Somewhat. I mean, I’ve made choices. We all make choices. But what exactly governs the final trigger to make a choice? I mean, my robotics work seems to stem from a natural inclination toward that type of work. And maybe I could be focused on something different, but I’ve chosen to follow these lil’ fuzzy feelings I feel when I solve engineering puzzles. And who knows what the final ramifications of my actions will be? Say I invent something radically new? Surely that will ease people’s pain while <i>also</i> causing suffering in some way.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Seems like you’re leaving an emergency exit open so you can throw up your hands and declare ignorance, thus jettisoning responsibility.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Dad!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> said. “Will you let <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span> eat?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Mrs. Eid leapt in. “What religion are your parents?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I took a bite of salad, chewing and swallowing. “My father seems to be a materialist with belief in the total disintegration of the mind upon death. My mother believes in souls, honouring our ancestors, and that our actions are laden with a quasi-electromagnetic attraction/repulsion that affects which demigod ethereal spirits reVolve or orbit within our aura.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And you?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I think there’s more to TheStory™, but I’m skeptical of OtherPeople’sStories™. I think our minds and the way we think are products of the evolutionary process – of DNA mutations and chemical interactions and random particle collisions – and this limits our ability to perceive and/or imagine objective reality. I cannot imagine a colour I’ve never seen before; how can I hope to imagine the Ultimate Ground of Being?”
