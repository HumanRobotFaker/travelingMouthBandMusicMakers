    A few mornings later, Xiander woke up and didn’t get out of bed. 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    He didn’t put on his iContacts™; he didn’t get up to urinate.

    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    He just laid there.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    <I>This time</I>, the doorbell-ringer was Andy. He stood at attention, fully bedizened in his preposterous military uniform full of patches and medallions of dubious origin.

    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Of course you’re depressed,” Andy laughed. “If I was hanging out with those Penguin Liberation Front jokers, I’d be depressed too.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Shut up.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Look, Xiander. We’re having a good time. You could be having a good time.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Andy handed Xiander a package of printed photos. All involved Andy and his gang, laughing, smiling, painting, collaging, colouring with crayons, and building shrines for the blanco religion.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Okay,” Xiander said. “You’re just going to keep pestering me anyway.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Attaboy,” Andy said. And the two marched over to Andy’s skyblue [pontiac bonneville] convertible.

    Jakob Rums, one & one-third meter tall, swung his pointer stick at the map taped to the wall. It was Antarctica, and they’d drawn all sorts of cities, mineral mines, and troop formations atop it. The South Ocean featured giant squid and the words <I>DANGER</I> over and over again.

    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “The Penguin Liberation Front almost wholly depends upon the assistance of foreign ecofreaks with disposable income. Therefore, if we cut off their illegal shipping channels,” Jakob hit the map with the pointer. “Then those rapscallions will starve atop the tundra.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Winfield raised his hand. “How does the crown handle former dissidents? Do they become reincorporated into society or are they deemed unredeemable?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Some are gassed and others are reincorporated,” Jakob said. “It’s all at the discretion of the crown. Whatever the solstar son does reckon to be a most effective deterrent against future insubordination.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Xiander followed his orders : colouring an entire sheet of paper with a piece of paraffin wax. The paper shined with illuminatory reflection, and the oils caked his nostrils.
