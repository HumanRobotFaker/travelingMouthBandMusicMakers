          Is TMB University Right for My Child?
        </h1>

      <p>
        When one immigrates to these here federated states, one arrives with the illusion of the ideal populace. One believes that the propagated ideals of these here federated states are uniformly championed by the native citizens. One expects the citizens to work hard, strive to be greater, and have a political interest in the governmental form that is democr’cy.
      <p>
        But that (as we all quickly learn) is not the <I>actual</I> case.
      <p>
        Many, if not most, of the native-born citizens are minimalists. They exert minimal effort in work, they attempt minimal learning at skool, and they desire minimal wisdom. They provide minimal parenting to their children and bestow minimal respect upon their elders. 
      <p>
        The children of these minimalists enter compulsory publikskooling with lexicons devoid of polysyllabic words and scant knowledge of abstract concepts that are the essence of literacy, mathematics, science, and history. And these offspring sit right next to your child, who can already read and perform basic mathematical operations. These offspring sit next to your child, who has experienced a childhood crafted toward the end of cultivating curiosity toward the world and existence on this planet. 
      <p>
        These spawn of minimalists not only sit next to your child – they <I>surround</I> your child. They confuse your child. They make your child wonder if they are aberrant because their interests and aptitudes don’t align with the common mass. And many parents find their children – following instincts of survival – attempting to acclimate to and/or adopt the norms of this brutish horde. 
      <p>

        Publikskool teachers are often well-meaning individuals. If given no other mandates, they would love to sit down next to your child and assist in their development toward being curious, intelligent, well-informed, and hyper-analytical adults. But they are not given “no other mandates”. They are given <I>many</I> mandates.
      <p>
        Those crafting curricular state standards have an eye to the sky and hope to elevate this nation-state’s youths to a deep understanding of their favoured discipline. But the entire funding and staffing apparatus in our publikskools are focused – not on lifting up more and more youths to the top echelon but – on merely lifting more and more youths out of the <I>bottom</I> gradient categories. Staff will spend a dozen hours in meetings surrounding a single student with a habitual tendency to stab pencils into peers’ necks, creating an array of creative policies and strategies in an attempt to keep this young human in the classroom. How many hours in meetings do you think they spend developing strategies to help your student with an off-the-charts reading/mathematics assessment and an intelligent quotient in the top three percent?
      <p>
        Oh, that’s right. They don’t <I>need</I> it.
      <p>
        Well, I, frankly, became sick of it. So I [dis]enrolled my teenage daughter from publikskool and applied for Traveling Mouth Band University. And she was accepted.

        How is TMB University better?
      <p>
        First and foremost, TMB University eliminates the problem of your gifted student being left waiting around (or worse :-- being asked to tutor) while hypointels fail to perform due diligence, fart around, and treat skool like the 8-16 daycare facility that many substandard parents clearly see it as. Now that my child is at TMB University, she can wake up and immediately strive toward the goals, projekts, and intellectual activities that are fit for her ilk. The impediments and obstructions of the lesser members of the classroom are immaterial for her now, because (#1) there is no classroom, (#2) there is no singularly scripted curriculum that a teacher must dragged the ignorant horde through, (#3) and overzealous litigiously-fearful cautionary measures no longer handcuff the physical movement of her burgeoning, curious mind that seeks wisdom and knowledge.
