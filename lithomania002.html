    About three meters deep, Hector reached an impasse. Below his feet seemed to be bedrock and it extended all across the floor of the hole. Not knowing what to do, he continued his previous strategy of dislodging rock: - dig wider until he found the edge of the rock. He picked a side of the hole and moved away the log-supports, so that he could climb out of the hole for the purpose of intentionally caving in the side of the hole. 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        All the depth he’d achieved was rapidly undone as regolith poured atop the s’posed bedrock. 

        <h1>          :: .03 :: </h1>
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        The hole grew wider and wider, but the edge of the potential bedrock could not be found. Eventually, Andrew returned to check on Hector’s progress.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“What are you doing?” Andrew asked.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Hector explained.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Andrew shook his head. “There are tools for that. They’re called feathers and wedges. I’ll be right back.”
