                “Hey yo!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Ramblehurst</span> T-T’d. “The normies are doing a Bounce!™ competition. It’s gonna start in fifteen minutes.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span>, with that scam TMB wealth, ordered us a robo-uber, as <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luna-id">Señor de la Luna</span> waved us goodbye. The robo-uber motored us up toward ShakerQuakerTown RD, where we passed <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s subdivision and instead headed up the hill that overlooked his neighborhood, where a NonSectarian™Temple is located. Near the top of the hill, before one hit the property-lined barbed wire, there resided a small parking lot that seemed to be <i>reasonably</i> far away from an unpopulated building with breakable windows.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Everyone was already there, dressed in costumes, with a few lugging around these oversized, pitch-painted faux-TV cameras made out of pinewood, as a line of 2-liter [Diet Citrus Drop] bottles were ceremoniously displayed on folding tables covered in black linen. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span>, whom I’d always known to be shy and quiet, stood before a faux-cameraman and spoke into a microfone.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Ladies, gentleman, and everyone else, welcome to the third installment of the notoriously elusive, <b><i><u>Super International Bounce!™ Association</u></i></b>. I’m McKathy Rowlinsin, your host for the ev’ning and we have a phantastik night set up ahead for you as the Mysterious Marauders take on the Performative Philharmonics to crown the first-ever Bounce Team Championship Belt.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="suraj-id">Suraj Palakadeti</span>, wearing an eyepatch over his glass eye as he flexed in a tanktop, high-fived <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">MarsBar</span>, who wore a big afropuff wig that brought to my attention shave marks beside her ears. Had she shaved her head?
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> did a hopping jig, as her dyed green hair matched the splotches of paint smeared across her face, as she clutched a silver flute. Teamed up with her was a young man in a traditional Ammonite outfit [<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">*</span>], whom my iContact™ apps could not identify whatsoever. He carried a wooden baseball bat like a cudgel and menacingly pounded the end into the palm of his hand.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “This episode of the SIBA is brought to you, once again, by <B><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="bernies-logo">Bernie's</span></B> <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="dietcitrusdrop-bounce">Diet Citrus Drop</span>, the official drink of plebian penguins within the confines of the Antarctic Kingdom,” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span></s> McKathy Rowlinsin said. “One of our judges for today’s event is the generalissimo who oversees all military activity for the continent atop the world: <i><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew Ramblehurst</span>!</i>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                A couple of faux-cameras encircled <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">Andrew</span>, who wore a highly bedizened version of his skout uniform, which sagged with patches, medals, sculptures, and medallions, as <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah Bleu</span> (in a simpler skout uniform) hovered over, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="flag-wave">furiously waving a bright ornj Antarctic flag</span>.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Our second judge for the ev’ning, standing at two-and-a-half meters tall, a spiritual cartographer with a specialty on the separation and extraction of different spooks, aurorally manifested on MontePicchu: <i>PotatoWoman!</i>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The faux-cameras encircled <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span>, who stood atop dress-hidden stilts, wearing a wig of preposterously long hair, as she juggled purple potatoes.	
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Our third and <i>final</i> judge is the primordial source of energy for all life on terra, the massive influence on the empty space in our celestial proximity causing our planet to circle ‘round and ‘round and ‘round – the fuser of hydrogen into helium, the body melting our faces today and covering us with sweat: <i>SOL!</i>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                And there was Sol, wearing solglasses in a giant cloth ornj+yellow sol outfit with spiky rays at the edges, shining a flashlight into the iContacts™ of anyone possibly serving as a source of creekstreaming.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “The games are about to begin,” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span></s> McKathy continued. “But before they do, we know that many viewers tonight are tuning in for the very first time. Therefore, we’ve asked the – as of twenty dekaseconds ago – acting commissioner of the SIBA, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya Tompkins</span>, to explain some basics about the great sport of Bouncing!™.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Then <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span></s> McKathy handed the microfone to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span>. As <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> talked, – for those creekstreaming – squares full of words reinforced her message. “The first thing most people ask is: how is this sport even played? Well, in tonight’s competition, two teams of two take turns attempting to perform the most beautiful, the most elegant, and the most <i>successful</i> bounce that sends a 2-liter rocketing up to the heavens.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The algos made me T-T a GIF of a horribly-designed humanoid face to the iContact™ creekstreaming this whole show and the face asked, “how is the ‘success’ of a bounce determined?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Thanks for asking, Igor of YellowKnife CANADA,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> said. “Every 2-liter bottle is equipped with a high-tech altimeter, provided to us by the fine people at PASCO™, which registers the ultimate height that each bounce attains.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “But this isn’t the only factor considered with each bounce,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> continued. “The other fact is BEAUTY & ELEGANCE, which are broken down into two aspects that we force our 3 judges to quantify. The first aspect is the simple aesthetic of the bounce’s trajectory. This ineffable quality often is the chaotic determinant of winners versus losers. It can be the arc, the sound, the twists – for most it’s a matter of chance, but for some masters, it's a matter of having that uniquely special touch.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Something that is more traditionally controllable is the second aspect of beauty & elegance: <i>presentation</i>. In this, we’ll see all sorts of elaborate, pre-pared role-play, choreography, and setting before the ultimate, titular act: <b><i>the bounce!™</i></b>”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="suraj-id">Suraj</span> and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> grabbed one of the two-liter bottles from the linen-covered folding tables, as <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="suraj-id">Suraj</span> wrapped it in a babyblanket, before tucking it into the crook of his arm. Then him and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> walk around the area, shushing everyone and holding their index finger to their lips.

                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U>McKathy Rowlinsin:</U></B> Ladies, gentlemen, and EE™, it seems the show is about to begin. The Mysterious Marauders are shushing and hushing the crowd, because they’re trying to put a pour lil’ bairn to sleep! 
                
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya Tompkins</span>:</U></B> The crowd respectfully quiets, but do you hear that, McKathy? I hear the baby’s cries.
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U>McKathy Rowlinsin:</U></B>  The cries are getting louder and louder, as <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="suraj-id">Suraj</span> looks frazzled and bent out of shape. He thrusts the wrapped green cylindrical baby into <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span>’ arms, but the sounds of the baby crying only get louder.
                
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya Tompkins</span>:</U></B> OH NO! <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> is upset! She’s shaking the baby! Never shake a baby!
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U>McKathy Rowlinsin:</U></B>  She throws the baby over to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="suraj-id">Suraj</span>, but the cries keep getting louder and louder! It’s deafening.
                
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya Tompkins</span>:</U></B> <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="suraj-id">Suraj</span> winds up, and 
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U>McKathy Rowlinsin:</U></B>  <i><b>BOUNCE!!!</b></i>
                
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<i>{The two-liter rockets upward into the heavens, as soda sprays downward. As the liquid propellent supply is exhausted, the hollow hunk of plastic follows back down to the terra.}</i>
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya Tompkins</span>:</U></B> The judges are conferring, before they finally hold up their placards. Each score has a maximum of 10.0, with a perfect score being 60.0 altogether.
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U>McKathy Rowlinsin:</U></B>  37.5! A fairly reasonable score.
                
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya Tompkins</span>:</U></B> I think the shaking-and-bouncing a human baby concept to be a little bit in poor taste.
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U>McKathy Rowlinsin:</U></B>  But now we’ve got the Performative Philharmonics up for their first bounce. They grab one of the two-liter bottles and – what’s this? A marching band?
                
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya Tompkins</span>:</U></B> A quartet featuring a trumpeter, tuba player, bass drum, and trombone are playing a fight song of some sort. They march across the parking lot, before the <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">unnamed Ammonite</span> takes the two-liter and leans over as if he’s a center in GridironFootball! <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> lines up behind him and she’s yelling ORNJ SPRINGS, FIELD SPRING, CREEK BEAVER - HUTT HUTT HUTT – 
                
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U>McKathy Rowlinsin:</U></B> The <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">unnamed Ammonite</span> pushes the two-liter between his legs to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> who drops back in a throwing position. The unnamed Ammonite runs forward, cuts left, and turns –
                
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya Tompkins</span>:</U></B> <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> with a lob pass to the <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">unnamed Ammonite</span>!

                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <B><U>McKathy Rowlinsin:</U></B>  The crowd cheers as the <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jeremiah-id">unnamed Ammonite</span> turns and runs to the end of the parking lot. TOUCH DOWN!
