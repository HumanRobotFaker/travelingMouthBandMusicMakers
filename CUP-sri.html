    <p>  <BR><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        The doctrine of Dream Drama Disassociation (3D™) stems from a rebellion against typical lucid dream practitioners (<I>otherwise known as Dream-Prayerers</I>), which seek to imbue a sense of profound meaning upon all dream images, seeking to metaphorically connect them to the divine realm.
        <BR><BR><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Sri PHepl resolutely rejects such notions. 
        <BR><BR> <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        The concept of Dream Drama Disassociation is intended to liberate the dreamer from the machinations in our sleeping life, which seek to make us believe that we are helpless witnesses being propelled along a moving escalator of sorts. 
        <BR><BR> <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        The first step to freedom is to remember your dreams. One remembers dreams when they <U>record</U> dreams.
        <BR><BR> <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        The second step to freedom is to <U>question</U> reality with proven lucid dream techniques.
        <BR><BR>  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        The third step to freedom is to <U>disassociate</U> one's self from the compulsions that the external dream environment seeks to stir within the dreaming individual.
        
            <BR><BR> ---------------------------------
          <BR><BR><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The snares of the DreamDrama™ reach to the core of the individual persona. They lead the dreamer to believe that their action (or nonaction) is of the utmost importance. The dreamer's naive gullibility causes them to travel from one emotionally-charged compulsion to the next, leading the dreamer down a never-ending maze of regrettable decisions. One ever-important mission becomes quickly forgotten in the pursuit of the next ever-important mission.
            <BR><BR><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Only upon recording one's dreams can the dreamer fully appreciate the absolute incoherence in these series of compulsions. Whilst other Dream-Prayer-Practitioners emphasize a personal meaning to the particulars of these compulsions, the honorable sri PHepl dismisses all compulsions as a material defect <B>of the animal mind</B>. One should NOT investigate these compulsions to aid in a fallacious narrative writing about one's persona (as other charlatans profess). Rather, the dream prayer practitioner is encouraged to liberate one's self from a belief in an external locus of control. The dream is, after all, the creation of the individual dreamer. It is an accretion of accumulated detritus from one's living life that should not be held as sacrosanct. <BR><BR><BR>
