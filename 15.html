                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> came over with <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Marissa</span>’s BCEC friend, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span>, and we went down to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span>’ family’s finished basement, which was the size of my entire house.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Who’s this?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> asked, nodding toward me.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “That’s <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander Xu</span>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “He’s in love with <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Marissa</span> even ‘though she’s a lesbian.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> rolled her eyes. “I hereby call to order the inaugural meeting of students for a free cap’listik democr’cy. Please take these role cards to help identify yourself for roll call,” and she passed out these pre-printed index cards. Then she elbowed me.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Um, hi, I’m <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander Xu</span>, Informational Technology Specialist.” I set the card down. “I thought this was a meeting for <i>anti-democr’cy?</i>” 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “As I told you before,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said, “one can’t have a counter-revolution without a proper revolutionary force <i>first</i>. And if we leave it up to your buddies at Border Line, it’ll never happen.” Then she pulled her card up to her face. “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali Pahlavi</span>, director of strategic maneuvers.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                There was an awkward pause. “I’m <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya Tompkins</span>, creative solutions advocate for overcoming antagonism. Two years ago, I went to skool underneath Mr. Cox, BeaverCreek’s new prince-o’-pull.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And I’m <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars Ares Bellicose</span>, KublaKhan of War. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span>: – tell us about Mr. Cox.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well, Mr. Cox is a rule-maker. He came into our skool and immediately made all these rules. What direction can one walk in a particular hallway? Can one chew gum? Can one drink non-water liquids in non-transparent containers? Does one have the right to <i>not</i> know the skool song? To show their barren shoulders?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So he’s a control freak,” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> exhaled and shrugged. “My mama knew him growing up in TrotWood [Dayton suburb, west of I-75]. She said he was a good man and what I needed to realize was that adults have to mind children <i>differently</i> in a more predominantly black area. One can’t do this TMB, loosey-goosey, do whatever you <i>feel</i> parenting; to do so would be a <i>disservice</i> to the children. You must instill respect, discipline, and hard-work values into them, <i>especially</i> if too many of them – for whatever valid socioeconomic reasons – are not experiencing such ethics at home. It’s a matter of life or death.” Then she paused. “So says my mama.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yeah, my parents were raised on that shit too. Albeit in Azia. That’s why they never sent me to normieSkool.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> clapped her hands in mock applause toward me. “And my parents believe in a stark dividing line between the betters™ and the haveNots™. <i>Anyhow</i>, what I take from your explanation, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span>, is that Prince’o’pull Cox’s style of authoritarianism is adaptive but may be <i>maladaptive</i> in this new environment with a different student population. So if he tries this micromanaging nonsense, he’ll hear some nasty feedback. And our goal is to transform that feedback into a force that propels a student democr’cy movement.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I stopped listening and began focusing on using my iContacts™ to order around an AI app to program a platform to host multimedia for discussion on voting items to change an AlmightySkoolRuleBook. Then I found a somewhat modern set of bylaws in an old BCEC student handbook, and began scanning the text for plausibly problematic provisions (such as a paragraph dictating the non-ability for students to wear certain colour combinations that are s’posedly associated with certain street gangs). I wrote up a proposed rule modification, had the AI create some fake student profiles, and had the AI begin creating debate content arguing for and against the proposed modification.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                In the background, I heard <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> say: “What’s wrong with his eyes?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “He has iContacts™. The computer kind,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said. “We’re veritable cyborgs at TMB,” and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> showed <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> the nano-sensitive probes sewn into the hair against the back of her skull. She sent a T-T that she was showing mine to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span>, so I leaned forward and let her touch my head while my eyes kept going crazy, setting up this wikiDemocr’cy.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “That’s… creepy,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “We can basically read one another’s minds,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> said, unpocketing and unfolding a large screen LCD MOB before she creekstreamed her channeling of my POV (assembling the wiki’mocr’cy). “Plus, we can send lil’ telepathic thought-texts to one another,” and then <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> transmitted a pieChart indicating the proportion of the time I’ve spent looking at the three girls since we entered the basement. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span>’s reflection entered my pupils the most. “As you can see, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span> can’t keep his eyes off you, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tamaya-id">Tamaya</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">KHALI</span>!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> said. “Will you leave the boy alone?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                    <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> smiled. “No.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It’s okay,” I said. “She’s just trying to immunize me to publik ridicule. Why? Who knows? But that’s all it is.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No,” she retorted. “I do it because I think <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>’s a creeper. But since he’s so harmless, it’s merely funny rather than scary.”
