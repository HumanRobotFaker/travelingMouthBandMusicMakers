            Jakob Rums wasn't @ TMB (although he prob'bly could've), but he liked participating in our eduProjekts. Hector wrestled with him at the B.C.E.C., so that was how he knew us (athough he also used to run off with  Winfield and smoke guat back in middleSkool). Jakob was barely over a meter-and-a-half in height, 48 000 grams in mass, and built like a hyper-muscled, golden-locked, pale-skinned, porcelain doll. He wore a bright red suit with pearl white shoes, as he'd come over to perform as his MCW moniker »Commie John», a man who sought to wrestle away the means of production from King Leroy and secure an egalitarian payscale ensured equal pay for all employees regardless of merit and/or effort.

            The boys had just filmed and were celebrating by passing around a vape-emit device loaded with a TNT-laden aquaeous solution [TNT is the active ingredient in guatama flower buds]. I felt the urge to try it, to see what it actually <I>felt</I> like, but I declined like I always did, despite the slow disintegration of my religious beliefs.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Hector's improved a lot in wrestling," Jakob said. "Last year was his first year on varsity and now he's absolutely killing it. So maybe the Dr. Dalton [lucid dream] [faeces] is helping in that regard."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Because he practices wrestling in his dreams?" Winfield asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Right," Jakob said. "I mean, just normal visualization-imag[e]ination has evidence that it increases task-success. They did an experiment with archery. So it makes sense that it would help with wrestling. Even if the rest - accrding to my guy - is spirtually dubious."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Your guy?" I asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Sri pHepL," Jakob said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "The guy Hector says is Ahriman incarnate?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Jakob grinned. "I can't really comment on that. I'm no theologian like Hector. My parents attend a non-sectarian [subsect] temple once every equinox, with saltine crackers and no broth."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Why is sri superiour to Dalton?" I asked.
            "Oh, nothing is superiour to anything else," he said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I sighed.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Winfield interjected. "Jakob, why do <I>you <B>prefer</B></I> sri pHepl over Doctor Dalton?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Jakob exhaled a transient cloud of water vapour. "Predominantly because he's not asking me for anything. Maybe he's data-mining; yes, he's drawing my attention; probably people give him monies. But he doesn't <I>ask</I> for monies and there are no ads on his site. No classes to sign-up for; no spots to type your credit card information. You go to one of his XYZ rooms and nobody's selling you a time-share."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Okay," I said. "So he's not a charlatan-salesperson. What's this sociopath spouting?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Jakob grinned. "We're not to discover our dreams, but to deny them. Not dive down labyrinth dream caves, ponder over cryptic gibberish allegories, and chase magickal animal-avatars. None of that. We're to stand before the dreamscape, see how it attempts to manipulate us into action, distract us from our lucidity, and then do nothing."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Nothing?"
                <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "Nothing."
                    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp "Not dream at all?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "No, that would be avoidance. You dream; you dream in the utmost vividity. And you realize you're free."
