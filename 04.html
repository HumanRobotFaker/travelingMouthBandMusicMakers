    <h1>.040</h1>

<P class ="newfont"> Because both Xiander and Hector refused to wear the iContacts™, Astronaut Al ordered a NyleDroneDelivery™ of a device that looked indistinguishable to a circular cosmetic compact. But when it was opened, there was no mirror. There was a liquid-crystal-display of a DeepFake robotic approximation of a human face. A human personality. </P>

<P class ="newfont">"Greetings!" the face sang to Hector. "I'm your automatic algorithmic advisor!"</p>
    
    <P class ="newfont"> Hector closed the compact. "What in kur is this?"</p>

        <P class ="newfont"> Astronaut Al smiled, his jaw masticating chewing gum in an attempt to overwhelm his yeefass stench at eleven in the morning. "It's [<span class="white-emphasis">TMB University</span>]'s tool to help you maximize your EspecialPoints <span class="white-emphasis">(EPs)</span>. </p>

            <P class ="newfont"> Hector looked over to Xiander in confusion.</p>

                <P class ="newfont">"Those are the kickbacks," Xiander said. "Your enrollments gets them tax¢oin, and this is how they kickback some to you, albeit with the caveat that you are «produ¢tive»."</p>

<P class ="newfont"> "Nevermind that cynical noise," Astronaut Al said. "TMB University is a <I>conCentrationCenter</I>, albeit with the caveat that the physical concentration takes place in dynamic locations rather than a permanent, static location." </P>

<h1>.041</h1>

<P class ="newfont"> Hector slowly opened the circular faux-cosmetic compact. </P>

                <h1>.042</h1>

                <P class ="newfont"> Hector and Xiander biked to the center of BeaverCreek, which happened to be in a subdivision along North Osborn RD, to knock on the door of one, <span class="violetstart">.</span><span class="violet hoverable" id="andrew">Andrew Ramblehurst</span><span class="violetend">.</span>, with whom Hector used to run cross-country. </P>    

                <P class ="newfont"> A mother opened the door. "Hector!" she said. "What are you doing here?" </P>

                <P class ="newfont"> "Just trying to get ahold of Andrew. Was wanting to use his artistic skills to good use." </P>

                <P class ="newfont"> "Come in, come in, and who is this?" </P>
        
                <P class ="newfont"> Hector introduced Xiander and they were invited into the living room, kicking off their shoes before they stepped onto the wall-to-wall carpet. Xiander and Hector sat down, and quickly, very quickly, Andrew Ramblehurst emerged. </P>

    <img src ="images/andySkout.png" class="prime2">

    <P class ="newfont">"Hector Chavez!" Andrew said. "Long time, no see!"</P>

    <P class ="newfont">"Hey Andrew," Hector said. "It's been a minute, hasn't it?"</P>

    <P class ="newfont">"Where you been, buddy? MarsBarCandyStar said you quit skool and became an anti-freeze huffing hobo in West Dayton."</P>

    <P class ="newfont"> Hector twitched. "MarsBarCandyStar?"</P>
    
    <P class ="newfont"> Andrew threw a nonchalant, dismissive wave. "The artist formely known as Marissa Eid. Anyhow, happy to see you're alive. What're you doing here? You've never been to my house." </P>

    <P class ="newfont"> "So, I didn't <I>quit skool</I>," Hector said. "I attend a gifted charterSkool with no physical conCentrationCenter. It's all online."
    </P>

    <P class ="newfont"> "What?" Andrew said. "One-day-a-week pullOut isn't good enough for you? It has to be alldays-a-week pullOut?"</P>

    <P class ="newfont">"Andrew," Hector said, "They haven't done gifted pullOuts since we were in primarySkool."</P>

    <P class ="newfont">Andrew turned to Xiander. "Are you part of this giftedSkool too?"</P>
    
    <P class ="newfont">Xiander nodded, but Hector interrupted. "Listen, Andrew, I'm here because a robotic algorithm suggested I hunt you down to see if you would do some art for our fantasy proRasslin' game." </P>

    <P class ="newfont"> "Sure, no problem," Andrew said, and then he ran upstairs. A moment later, he ran back downstairs, and handed Hector a laminated piece of cardstock. </P>

    <P class ="newfont"> "What's this?" Hector said.</P>

    <P class ="newfont"> "My pri¢es." </P>

 <h1>.042</h1>

 <P class ="newfont"> Hector handed back to the laminated menu of prices for services rendered. </P>

<P class ="newfont"> "You know I'm on federal assistance, right?"</P>

<P class ="newfont"> "You know I don't work for free, right?"</P>

<P class ="newfont">Xiander grabbed the laminated sheet, gave it a look, and then said, "Do you take barter? Exchange of services?"</P>

<h1>.043</h1>

<P class ="newfont">Andrew drove Xiander and Hector in his fifty-jaar old skyblue Pontiac convertible over to the house of <span class="greystart">.</span><span class="grey hoverable" id="winfield">Winfield Jones</span><span class="greyend">.</span>, whom Hector didn't know. Or, rather, he vaguely recalled seeing him from a distance at ths soccer complex. </P>

<P class ="newfont"> Winfield had a [human] on a leash. The [human] was mouthing grass blades as their fists clung tightly to dandelions torn from the earth. Hector had a hard time not staring at the [human]. </P>

<img src ="images/winfield-backyard002.png">

<P class ="newfont"> "I brought volunteers," Andrew said. </P>

<P class ="newfont"> Winfield brought a hand-rolled filterless cigarillo to his mouth with his free hand. "Cool," he said. "Grab some shovels. We're digging a hole."

<h1>.044</h1>

<P class ="newfont"> They dug a hole that was two meters by ten meters with a depth of one meter. It ran along the edge of the back property line, which bordered a maize field. Hector did most of the work, with Xiander feigning a shoulder injury so he could sit down next to Andrew and supervise his drawings. </P>

<P class ="newfont"> "Give Dead Man Douglas some stubble," Xiander told Andrew. "Make him look gritty and wisened from his spiritual travels in Nippon."</P>

<P class ="newfont"> Andrew followed the orders as Hector dug and Winfield smoked.</P>

<P class ="newfont"> "So you're trading manual labour for Andrew's drawings?" Winfield asked. </P>

<P class ="newfont"> "Yeah, for this eduProjekt for skool." </P>

<P class ="newfont"> "You know there's a thing called generative AI, right?" </P>

<P class ="newfont"> "Right. And there's evaluative AI that can tell the difference. Especially when it requires contextual evidence." </P>

<P class ="newfont">  Winfield throws a dismissive hand. "There's probably an easy workaround." </P>

<P class ="newfont"> "Sure," Hector said. "But sometimes the workaround is more work than just doing the work sincerely." </P>

    <P class ="newfont"> Then Hector returned to digging the hole. </P>

    <h1>.045</h1>

    <P class ="newfont"> By solset, the hole was dug. Then, under the backyard floodlights, the four of them all took turns dumping the soil right back into the hole, beating the soil with mattocks as they returned it. Tomorrow, they would repeat the process, slightly modified.</P>

                <P class ="newfont"> As Xiander and Hector left the backyard, Xiander turned to Hector. </P>

                <P class ="newfont"> "Can I spend the night at your place?" Xiander asked. </P>

                    <P class ="newfont"> The next morning, Andrew picked up Xiander and Hector with that skyblue convertible. </p>

                        <P class ="newfont"> "Change in plans, my fellow compatriots," Andrew announced. "Hector's cornergodd came to me in a vision last night during a lucidDream, and he indicated that it was my solemn duty to take you out to the woods, drink yeshiTea, and commune with the great ground of being." </P>
            
                        <P class ="newfont"> "Oh?" Hector said. The Triple-A [Sam] in his compact had simply stated they needed to get Andrew to dress up in a costume and AV-record some promotional speech for MoonChampionshipWrestling. </P>

                        <P class ="newfont"> "Yes. Then my holy vision was complimented with a mundane, physical leaflet that was left on my bedroom window pane, ostensibly by a cybernetic bird from an alternate dimension." </P>

<img src ="images/teaPartyInvite.png" alt="a fancy piece of parchment that reads: we beseech your attendance to a divinely inspired event, a yeshian tea party. expect enlightenment and expansion. prepare yourself beforehand by taking a bath and refraining from foodstuffs for a demi-day.">

<P class ="newfont"> Xiander's eyes bulged toward Hector as he passed back the invitation. </P>

<P class ="newfont"> "Andrew," Hector said, "we didn't bathe."

    <P class ="newfont"> Andrew threw a dismissive hand. "No worries," he said. "We've got a bath all set up for you at the compound."   </P>
    
        <h1>.048</h1>

        <P class ="newfont"> The compound was east of Xenia, in PineVille. There was a porcelain, ceremonial bath placed in the middle of a small exteriour "room", surrounded by consciously cultivated landscaping, bushes, a trellis of roses, statues, and [so on and so forth]. </P>

So Hector stripped down to nothing, and then steps into the lukewarm water of the ceremonial bath. </P>

        <P class ="newfont"> "Glorious is he, who departs without fear from the artificial coverings of our nakedness!" Andrew sang. </P>
