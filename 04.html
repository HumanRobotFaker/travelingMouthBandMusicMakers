                “Let’s clean this house,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Wait, what?” 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You ever leave on vacation and return to a dirty house?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I have. It’s so much less nice than coming home to a clean house,” and she started picking up random dirty dishes lying about the house.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “But isn’t this the work for <i><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s family</i>?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You’re his friend, right?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> said. “You know his story, right?” And I did. Dad died when Hector was a toddler (single-car accident on wintry rural road, driving home from a [bar]) and Mom was looney-tunes crazy, an emotional tornado of fury whenever she was around, which was rarely. Thus, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> and his brothers lived in squalor and filth, in a house that used to be perfectly nice, until one-by-one a zillion small things broke and never got fixed.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                So I helped her clean. I mean, I crushed on her, so there wasn’t any real choice, but, just to be clear, she never showed any sign of romantic interest in me.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Did you and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> date?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Before he dated <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span>, we saw a play and he felt me up. I mean, <i>right before</i> he and <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span> dated. Like two days later, I looked at his [site on] InfiniSpace and they were in a relationship.” She turned on the sink water and began attacking the pyramid of dirty, mismatched dishes. “I thought about telling <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni</span>, but my mom advised me not to.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “You told your mom?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I tell my mom everything. My dad, not so much.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “How come?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “That’s how us Maniis do. Mothers raise and educate the children; Fathers stay out of the way.” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> handed me a wet, clean dish and I searched every drawer to find a clean cloth to dry it with. “Anyhow,” she continued, “that’s before I decided to be done with dating men. They’re biologically predisposed to be faithless.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                My heart dropped in my chest. “That’s very confusing.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Huh?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I recently read your essay on gender nihilism.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                She looked at me. Then she looked back down at the dish she was scrubbing. “Well, gender is different than biological sex.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I mean, I get that, but I don’t get how one can be a gender nihilist yet dismiss a whole gender – or biological sex – from romantic consideration.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well, I never said I was a gender nihilist. I merely wrote a reflection upon the concept. And then there was silence for a while, as <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="mars-id">Mars</span> grabbed a hard plastic widget (a broken piece of spatula) and used it to break up the hardened food adhered to the bottom of a pan. “Men’s biology makes them not take sex seriously. It’s simple math and logick: they have one gazillion [gametes] and zero percent chance that the action leads to a biological <i>mass</i> growing inside them.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So we’re slaves of biology? Isn’t that the argument for chauvinism?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “It can be,” she said. “But I think you’re misrepresenting me. You’re taking my transient thoughts and cementing them so you can make a statue of them.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I laughed. I dropped it. We kept cleaning. My iContactsTM lit up with autoAlgoAdvisors encouraging me to keep cleaning.
