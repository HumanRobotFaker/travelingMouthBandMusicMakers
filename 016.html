            With the productivity points (PP) earned by the proRasslin' noise, many items and tools were purchased for utilization on other eduProjekts™ by the boys. When I went over to Uriah's mother's condo to swim, Uriah's latest little spoil-of-war was an anglotranslation of an ancient indoChina text that [my AAA indicated] spent a large proportion of its characters detailing the differences betwixt HighPeople and LowPeople. The latter of which were s'posedly best treated like low-sentient animals to lure with carrots and beat with sticks so as to best fulfill their «divine duty» in doing the bidding of their betters (TheHighPeople).
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Ah," I said. "Preparing for Slavery2.0?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            He lowered his book and lated at me through his tinted solglasses. "Just researching for a religious text we're preparing to justify the subjugation of the lowly penguin and its transformation into a cybernetic superiour species."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "You know, it'd make more sense if these penguins were doing something aquatic. That's where they actually thrive. Putting them in factories and ice mines when they lack opposable thumbs makes no sense." Then I took off my shirt and shorts, reveleaing my one-piece swimsuit. It was the most skin I'd ever shown to anyone outside my family. I feigned nonchalance.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "well," he said, pausing probably to dismiss perverse thoughts, "the absurdity is a facet of the humour, MarsBar."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I removed and cased my iContacts™, shoving them into one of my disrobed pockets whilst simultaneously becoming hyperaware that I didn't know how to turn my body to minimize <span class="censored">[censored]</span> I might be giving everyone.
