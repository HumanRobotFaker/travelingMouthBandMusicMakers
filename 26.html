                “So, I’m confused,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> said. “We’re pretending – I mean, really – bringing professional wrestling shows to the various mines and factories where cybernetic penguins will work.
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     
                “Yes,” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob Rums</span></s> Commie John said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And these penguins are shipped from Antarctica because they can be hired for lower wages, less benefits, and less s’posed hassle than normal human workers.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “That’s correct,” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob Rums</span></s> Commie John said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And this helps [positively] accelerate the communist revolution, how?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> applied makeup to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span>’s face, as he stood around with crepe-paper party-streamers hanging from his biceps, while <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah Bleu</span> looked out a window while I sat next to him. I wasn’t sure why <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span> wasn’t in the bright red suit today, but I was too busy to ask as my eyeballs twitched every which way as I attempted to troubleshoot the democr’cy site
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well, first off,” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John said, rubbing his hands together, “the professional wrestlers in our league will be compensated on a flat, egalitarian scale, with excellent benefits.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> said, “say, through my excellent acting and exceptional physique, I end up having my t-shirt sell at an exponentially high rate compared to my coworkers. Am I s’posed to split the proceeds with those unpopular losers?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “If the T-shirts are sold at our PCW shows or on our PCW interweb site, yes, it will be distributed equitably.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Garbage,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> said, as <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> applied the eyeliner pencil to him.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John continued. “So here we are: we have a crowd full of cybernetic penguins, who’ve been used and abused every day for their entire waking cycle, making quarter bits of coin to send back to their family in West Antarctica, when they are exposed to a group of performers who get paid better than them, under an egalitarian salary schedule that promotes the common worker welfare, and only have to exert themselves about twenty minutes a night. Our supersecret cabal of revolutionaries believe this will cause the imported cybernetic penguins to start asking questions about their own treatment.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Or they’ll just murder the wrestlers out of jealousy,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span> said, looking out the window.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I turned toward <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span>. “You are not a true believer of Commie John’s project to liberate the penguin servant class by exposing them to muscled men in tight pants?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Save them,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span> said. “And they’ll just find a new class of individuals to exploit. And then the penguins will be back to unemployment.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Exactly!” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John said. “Away from the alienation that is the nature of work in our modern industrial society.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And back to nature,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span> said, “pissing on their feet, naked, in negative 90° weather.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> asked, “Is <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span> supposed to be part of the Penguin Liberation Front or the Kingdom of Antarctica? Without iContacts™, it’s hard to keep track of all this. I thought this was for the King, as we’re entertaining his exported slavePenguins, after all. But then you start talking all this commie talk, which I thought was more of a PLF thing since the King is supposed to be hyperConsumerism, so now I’m confused.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Realpolitik is not for the feeble minded,” Commie <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s> John said. “You should rest your cerebral cortex, Mr. Democracy Man, we don’t want you to overexert yourself before we film your [promo].”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Sir, yes sir,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> responded. He saluted.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Plus, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span> probably shouldn’t be here,” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John said. “His granddaddy passed away.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh no!” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> said. “I’m so sorry, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I patted <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span> on the back, which caused him to jerk a little.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “He was old,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span> said. “It was his time.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Still,” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John said. “Senescence is a [redacted].”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I’m leaving tomorrow,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah</span> said. “Y’all’re right. I shouldn’t be here.” Then he stood up, waved goodbye, and left.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh I feel so bad for him,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I T-T’d <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span>: “Don’t you believe in reincarnation?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                She T-T’d me: “Perception of separation is painful in spirits seeking union; nevermind if that perception is faulty or fallacious on a GroundOfBeing-level.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So….” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> said aloud. “Xiander. Khali told me that you and Tamaya are dating.” Then he winked at me. “Niiiiiiiiiiiiicceeeeee!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I grabbed the crowd of my head and rubbed my hair viciously. “Don’t believe anything Khali says,” I said. “She’s obsessed with sexualizing me.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Are you asexual?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No,” I said. “I am not,” and I wanted to bring up my experiences with Roxxxie™ to accentuate that, but I couldn’t because it was a secret.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Have you dated anyone?” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John asked. “I mean, I haven’t. I’ve been too busy focusing on the revolution. Plus, being only a meter-and-a-half tall, I have the unfortunate tendency to fall in limerence with females taller than me in a world where primitive urges dictate that most heterosexual females want a male who is taller than them.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Great self-awareness,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> said. “I hear <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> has stilts you can borrow. With newCentury technology, we can overcome this physical handicap you possess, my midget friend!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “No,” I said. “According to the interwebs, dating means seeing someone regularly with the intention of taking the relationship ToTheNextLevel™. I have no desire to go ToTheNextLevel™ anytime soon.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Sounds fair,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> said. “There are many things to do in life other than chase limerent relationships.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Sounds gay to me,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> said. “You can just admit it, Xiander. We’re all allies here.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> backed away from <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> with her eyeliner pencil. “We’re ready.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Commie <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John rolled the large camera into position in front of the green screen. “Come on, Mr. Democracy. Let’s show the world who you are!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="luuk-id">Luuk</span> stood in front of the green screen and faced the video camera. He balled his right hand into a fist and punched the palm of his other hand. “I’m Mr. Democracy and I’ve been subjugated to the corners of these here federated states for far too long!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                He paused, grimaced, and punched his palm again. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So Penguin Wrestling Federation, you’ve been warned! Democracy is no longer going to be waiting in the annals of the future – it is coming to you NOW, with AUTHORITY, and GREAT POWER. And anyone who wants to get in my way, better beware! Because THE FUTURE IS COMING! And it smells like MISTER…DEMOCRACY!!!!”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Commie <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John clapped loudly. “Perfect! Perfect! Who needs a second cut? Not me! I cannot wait for your match with the unnamed Ammonite.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Unnamed Ammonite?” I said.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yeah,” <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John said. “You know, the guy who Bounced! with Khali. Apparently she found this guy at the Dayton [Metropolitan] Library. Doesn’t speak a lick of Anglo.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “He speaks Anglo,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> said. “That’s how Khali met him at the library; he was taking a class and checking out books about how to learn Anglo.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <s><span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="jakob-id">Jakob</span></s>John threw a hand in dismissal. “He grew up not knowing a lick of Anglo, even though he spent most of his childhood in eastern OIHO. Isn’t that crazy?”
