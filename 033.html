            “Men are going to try and replace women,” Khali said. “With roboHos and sexxxBots, and freaky half-humanoid genetic monsters with soft orifices just the right size with no teeth.” This was in response to me telling her about Hector’s secret agop, the suitcase, and Khali’s older brother’s creepy funeral advances. “We should probably do it first; I mean, do we really need a y-chromosome fouling up the population? Maybe your first thought has been your best thought :- we should all be lesbians.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “That was <I>not</I> «my thought»,” I said. “I simply said <I>I</I> am a lesbian.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Sure sure,” Khali said. “A lesbian who is jealous and incensed that a particular man has a secret [agop] who drops everything and runs to him the moment her MOB vibrates with a ‘u up?’ thought-text.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “I’m <I>upset</I>,” I said, “because he and I’re s’posed to be a <I>total trust society </I>, but he’s <I>hiding</I> this to maintain some sort of false image of himself in my psyche.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “So he’ll be able to seduce you later.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Stop.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “What? I’m serious,” Khali said. “Why else would he do it? Because he’s afraid he’d lose your friendship?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “That’s not enough motivation?”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Maybe. Or maybe he’s afraid this information will repulse you and close that plausible door forever. But based on my <I>recent</I> conversations with Winfield, I’m pretty sure Hector is confused and should’ve just been open about this [agop] girl. I mean, plenty of women get <I>spurred</I> into action when they learn of competitors.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Spurred,” I said. “You just used an animal husbandry metaphor.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Khali shrugged. “We’re mammals, Mars. Read it and weep.”
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            We walked in silence down the Narrows path along the little Beaver Creek. I looked up at the canopy and thought about the tall trees tryin’ to gobble up all the solshine.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Down the path, Andrew and his short friend Jakob were swinging off the rope swing, splashing, and swimming in the water. I thought about sexbots replacing women and I just found the whole idea strange. Khali and I swung off the rope swing and splashed in the water, swimming with them. The sol shone and the wind blew and everything was just so pleasant. 
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            Khali unceremoniously brought up Hector’s secret [agop]. The boys didn’t seem to know about it, but they didn’t flinch either.  
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Why do you think Hector would lie about that?” Khali asked them.
            
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            
            “Simple,” Andrew said, as we all treaded water together. “Same reason a government lies to its civilians about colonizing, conquest, and war. If others knew how truly base and disgusting one’s actions <I>actually</I> were, something might then get in the way of them continuing to do whatever the fukk they want.”
