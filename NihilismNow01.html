<p>     Recently, another Shamshounian xenophobe took a canister full of chemical potential energy, pulled a magic trigger that allowed molecular collisions to occur, and transformed that potential energy into thermal energy that accelerated a bunch of aerodynamic metals. The intended purpose of this act was simple: to kill as many dark-skinned people as possible. 
  <p> 
  And now this xenophobe sits, shackled in a cage. But as much as he shoves on the walls of his cell, Ahuramazda is not going to imbue him with a super strength that will cause the roof to fall on everyone. 
  <p> 
  Because Ahuramazda does not exist.
  <p> 
  Think about this: this individual used to be able to freely promenade in any direction across these federated states. Sure, there are material considerations: it’s hard to travel very far without money for combustible gasoline and pistons to spin rubber wheels (which Newton’sThirdLaws the wheels forward by pushing backward against the ground). One also requires food and drink to survive. Et cetera, et cetera. But before this act, this individual was a free human being. In a blessed world where so much is possible, such as living in a digital fantasy world with folks from across the globe and/or having endless copulation with sexbots.

  <p> 
  And now they’re in a cell. Without pause. Until they’re dead. And for what?
  <p> 
  There is a form of economics that promotes the idea that human beings are rational creatures who make decisions according to their self-interest. And while this <i>can</i> be the case, often I witness individuals – such as this newly incarcerated Shamshounian – acting with a total disregard to their own self-interest. They believe they’re working toward a higher cause, but I’ll tell you what’s really happening:
  <p> 
  Ghosts.
  <p> 
  Ghosts begin as simple ideations. An image arises in an individual’s head. It’s as if they can see it with their own eyes. Perhaps it is a simile: this is like that. Perhaps it is the more nefarious permutation that is metaphor: this isn’t just <i>like</i> that, this <i>is</i> that. 
  <p> 
  Most ideations materialize and dissipate within one’s consciousness. But some take root. Some keep returning, over and over again. Some take up so much room that there’s little space for anything else. 
  <p> 
  Suddenly, the human being gets this glazed look over their eyes. They begin acting as if they are a new individual. Beware! This person is now under the control of an ethereal spirit! They have become possessed! A ghost possesses them now!
  <p>
    <p><img src="images/DasanaqufinaHappySpringYeshi.png"></p>
  </p>
  <p> 
  The ghost controls how they move. How they act in different circumstances. How they perceive their surroundings.
  <p> 
  The ghost makes the corporeal body do its bidding. The ghost does not care what becomes of the stinking piece of meat. The ghost has its own purposes. 
  <p> 
  Evict the ghost from your head! You are not the ghost. Satiating the ghost’s desires is not the same as acting in your own self-interest. 
  <p> 
  Shamshounianism, this ridiculous attempt to augment oneself with an increased imbuement of importance by pretending they are in union with a fable told five thousand years ago, is but one ghost that possesses humans. They’re beyond innumerable. I have a friend who cannot walk into a $uperMart™ without suddenly sputtering and spitting about SlaveSweatShops, monopolies, and – as their head spins, eyes rolling in the back of their head – blabbing about the importance of small mom-and-pop shops. I have another friend who is struck blind and enters into a hysteria when anyone says certain magick words, causing their pupils to dilate as their mouth opens wide to make room for the outpouring of a LogicTrain copy-and-pasted from [somewhere on the interwebs].
  <p> 
  The ghosts are real and one should be wary. They ceaselessly work to import their importance into your skull. These ghouls wish to establish residence in your brain, moaning and wailing, interrupting your enjoyment of life. Attempting to control your limbs and command your actions.
  <p> 
  Don’t let them. Following their orders will not lead you to glory. 
  <p> 
  Case-in-point: this foolish Shamshounian horr’rist machine-gunning a bunch of random dark-complected people because the ghost made him feel a “duty” to advocate for the well-being of anglo-blancos. The ghosts said that it was now time to <I>do</I> something. Why did the ghost want him to do something? So that the very ghost that inhabits his head could exponentially thrive and inhabit more heads. 
  <p> 
  Meanwhile, his corporeal ass is locked in a jail cell. Until he dies.
