           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Khali told me that my claiming to be a lesbian was an act of homophobia. How? Because she believed that I wasn't an <I>actual</I> lesbian, yet I nonetheless <I>chose</I> to identify as an <I>actual</I> lesbian, which would inevitably lead to a situation where I'd abandon my lesbianism ("perhaps with Hector?" she said), all and all casting a shadow of doubt upon the concept of lesbianism, supporting notions that it wasn't gentically ingrained but a peverse choice that could be frivolously tossed aside at a moment's notice <I>when convenient</I>.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "Wow," I said. "It's almost like we shouldn't take elements of the subset and have them define the set as a whole."
<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
    "Okay, brainyaptitude," Khali said, which was what she'd called me ever since I scored higher than her on the Cerebral Cognitive Concept Predictor we took to be admitted into [TMB]. "But I still predict that your identity as a lesbian is dominantly a byproduct of high-IQ-fueled misanthropy in general, aided and abetted by the retarded matural development of the y-chromosomed. And as the males <I>finally</I> catch up, you will find at least one that you are - traditionally - and heterosexually, attracted to."
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        I s'posed this was why people lied. Why they kept thoughts to themselves. Why they didn't casually mention that they were feeling a wee bit attracted to a certain silly boy, even though he happened to sleep fourteen hours a day as part of some nutcase LucidDream cult.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        It was difficult to hear that critique and not immediately rush off and <I>do something</I> :- avoid Hector, t-t a geoproximate female, or reconvene in an XYZ room with an old [e-]"girlfriend" who lived two megameters away. And I guess I <I>did</I> <u>rush off and do something</u>, but it was primarily to deal with the <i>feeling</i> that I wanted to <u>rush off and do something</u> :- I t-t'd my spiritual ad<B>vis</B>or and we met in an XYZ room.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Marissa," they said. "Why have you summoned us?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "My cousin, who is also my friend, attacked my sexual identity as fradulent, and laid out a list of potential activities that would - no ony prove this fraudulence - but furthermore <I>harm</I> other people who share this identity, s'posedly more sincerely than I."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        I enabled [limited] access to my iContacts™ audiovisual recording. They advisor paused to review the shared materials.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        They returned.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Our actions, by their nature, have consequence," they said, "of varying degrees of magnitude and transience. Prior to their implementation, we can credibly <B>vis</B>ualize <I>all sorts</I> of possibilities. But there is no certainity of what <I>actually</I> will prevail. Moreover, human description of human activities is a palimpsest which can ever be washed away and engraved anew --" and then I unsubscribed and exited the XYZ room.
