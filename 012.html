           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Khali told me that my claiming to be a lesbian was an act of homophobia. How? Because she believed that I wasn't an <I>actual</I> lesbian, yet I nonetheless <I>chose</I> to identify as an <I>actual</I> lesbian, which would inevitably lead to a situation where I'd abandon my lesbianism ("perhaps with Hector?" she said), all and all casting a shadow of doubt upon the concept of lesbianism, supporting notions that it wasn't gentically ingrained but a peverse choice that could be frivolously tossed aside at a moment's notice <I>when convenient</I>.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                "Wow," I said. "It's almost like we shouldn't take elements of the subset and have them define the set as a whole."
<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
    "Okay, brainyaptitude," Khali said, which was what she'd called me ever since I scored higher than her on the Cerebral Cognitive Concept Predictor we took to be admitted into [TMB]. "But I still predict that your identity as a lesbian is dominantly a byproduct of high-IQ-fueled misanthropy in general, aided and abetted by the retarded matural development of the y-chromosomed. And as the males <I>finally</I> catch up, you will find at least one that you are - traditionally - and heterosexually, attracted to."
    <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        I s'posed this was why people lied. Why they kept thoughts to themselves. Why they didn't casually mention that they were feeling a wee bit attracted to a certain silly boy, even though he happened to sleep fourteen hours a day as part of some nutcase LucidDream cult.
