                I tried to stay away from home as much as possible. My parents were s’posedly getting divorced, so they slept in different bedrooms. And since we only had a two-bedroom house, Dad’s bedroom was the shed in the backyard. When I arrived home, Dad’d already gone to bed, but I could still smell the odor of his old-fashioned combustion cigarettes.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I’m sorry,” Mom said, “but that’s too many nights staying at friends’ houses. Are you on drugs? Have you been drinking?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Nah, Mom. But I did see some inebriated hypointels.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">Xiander</span>! You need to stay away from that sort of activity. And don’t use <i>that word</i>; it’s biggoted, unempathetic, and trains your mind to de-humanize.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yes, ma’am. How’s work? Did you get flowers I had [NyleDrone] delivered? I didn’t see them in the front.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I planted them in the back. I’m focusing on sprucing up the backyard. Your dad’s almost finished with the bocci ball course.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I looked out the back window. The security lights from the backshed illuminated the yard and the raised, brick-bordered bocci ball court. Mom’d planted the flowers all along the backshed, which was newly repainted.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                All my life, the backyard had been our dog’s domain: dirt, weeds, patches of grass, torn up dog toys, faeces, and piss. But now that he’s dead, it’s all been steamrolled into beautification, as if he never lived at all.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Looks great, Mom,” I said. “I bet you’re really proud.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Thank you, son,” and she smiled.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And work?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Her smile twitched and then returned. “I got that promotion to supervisor. I’ll be salary soon.”
