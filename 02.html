<P> Hector and Britni knew each other from the BCCC  <span class="white-emphasis">(BeaverCreekConcentrationCenter)</span> Cross Country Team. She was the #1 runner on the girls' team and amongst the best in the whole state of OHIO, and he was on the cusp of barely being on the boys' competition team, so they made good off-season practice partners. </P>
    
    <p>So they'd run together and chatted with each other on their SOBs <span class="white-emphasis">[Britni's parents wouldn't let her have a MOB]</span>, but they'd never otherwise hung out together. So it was weird when Britni's parents pulled into his driveway to take him to their temple. In preperation, Hector had mowed the lawn, trimmed the bushes, and cleaned up all the clutter in the visible portions of the yard, because he knew what straight-laced suburbanites they presented themselves to be. </p>

<p> Britni's temple eschewed permanent seating, so the two of them sat on the floor, whilst her parents and brother stood nearby. The intimacy of being there one-on-one with her, their knees slightly grazing together, made Hector consider the following: maybe he wanted to be romantically involved with Britni. </p>

<p> But he'd never considered it before. Because she had a boyfriend. And she seemed like a good person. And Hector felt an aversion to «corrupting» individuals whom he'd come to believe were genuinely good persons. </p>

<p> But at some point during the templeTime, she looked over at him and gave this smile. And Hector decided he didn't care anymore.</p>

Well, first off, I think my feelings are complicated. Intellectually, I realize that yeshi promoted an anti-materialistic message that runs contrary to the elaborate, orante temples of the [Europa] Universal Bevy. But aesthetically, I've grown accustomed to the way my old temple is designed.

 I think it looks messy, personally. And I disagree with your sentiments about ANY separation being antithetical to yeshi's message. I mean, separation is NATURAL, just think about all the membrane-bound organelles within a eukaryotic cell. Everything is organized and separated. And it's important to have that differentiation.

    My biggest complaint regards your temple leader. She did something that I've come to call «verse-hopping». Basically, it's when a speaker starts cherry-picking quotes and verses from the DivineAnthology, one line at a time, and then in the next sentence, they're quoting a DIFFERENT verse from a DIFFERENT book, written on a different continent during a different century, completely ignoring or abandoning the context of what they're quoting. It's intellectual brain rot. And it's a dishonest practice that can allow one to craft any argument and makes it speciously appear to be backed by the Divine Anthology. As if the Divine Anthology is one monolithic thing, instead of an amalgamation of varied sources.

<P> They started going on dates. Running dates. At first, they would meet at different places in BeaverCreek. The bikepath, the narrows nature preserve, rotary park, et cetera. But as Hector began to earn EspecialPoints<span class="white-emphasis"> (EPs)</span> at TMB University, he began able to order roboTukTuks to ferry them to different locations in the neighbouring municipalities.  </P>

<p> They went to OrnjSprings, so they could jog through the flat parts of the SeleneGulch nature preserve. They ran and at the end of the run, they sat underneath a tree together. They hadn't seen another human in an hour. </p>

<p> "Sebastian is coming home soon," she said. "The semester is almost over."</p>

<p> "Does that mean we'll be spending less time together?" Hector asked. </p>

<p> "Not necessarily," she said. "I just don't know. Maybe."</p>

<P> "What do you guys like to do for fun?"</P>

<p> "Movies, board games, the usual stuff."</p>

<p> "Oh okay."</p>

<p> "I really appreciate all the time we've spent running. It's definitely pushed me to a new level."</p>

<p> "Great," Hector said. "I've enjoyed our time together too." </p>

<P> Then she invited herself over to Hector's house on a SaturnDay morning. Hector rushed to clean everything up, but there was really nothing he could do. He could not hide the fact that he did not live with two engaged parents who believed divine living encompassed home improvement and a [liveLaughLove] suburban aesthetic. </P>

<p> There was nothing Hector could do about the holes in the walls on such short notice. The torn linoleum. Stains on carpet. Burnt out lightbulbs. Et cetera, et cetera. </p>

<p> "Is your dad not here?" Britni asked</p>

<p> "No," Hector said. He hadn't seen his dad in eight days.</p>

<p> "Oh," Britni said. "My parents wouldn't want me here with no parents home."</p>

<p> Hector laughed.  </p>

<p> She looked quizically at him.</p>

<p> "My dad wouldn't stop anything from happening," he said. He thought of Alana Sun <span class = "censored">[redacted]</span>.</p>

<p> Britni thought something but didn't say anything. They sat on a broken, ripped, pleather couch and shared a spiral notebook together, taking turns in constructing prime number factor trees together. </p>
