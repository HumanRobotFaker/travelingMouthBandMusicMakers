            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> hung out with <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">me</span> the day before <a href = "03.html">he inserted himself into the glass coffin</a>, an act that has widely been criticized as being <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="dr-dalton-casket">“self-indulgent and derivative”</span>. His demeanor could be described as manic and enthused. Oh what great wonders and wisdom he’d encounter upon his medically-induced multi-week foray into the <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="tvprophet">LucidDreamRealm<sup>TM</sup></span>! Nevermind (and certainly not discuss) the aspect that this motivation toward <a href = "selfobliteration01.html">
                
                
                
                self-obliteration</a> – temporary as it may be – was precipitated by <a href ="BritniBreakup00.html"> the break-up of his relationship </a>with <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="britni-id">Britni Lyn Sheba</span>. Ahuramazda had destined <a href ="/pdf/UnauthorizedBiographyDalton.pdf"> this emulation of  Dr. Dalton </a> so <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> could ascend to TheNextLevel of his transformation into the UltimateProtagonist, long heralded and sung about on the [10 000] pages of the Divine Anthology.</p>

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “My avatar is going to lead me to the ultimate ground of being within the black hole at the center of our spiral galaxy,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> declared, as he cleaned up piles of dirty clothes littered across his bedroom floor.</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“You know what <i> actually </i> happens when you encounter a black hole?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> asked. “Spaghetti-fication.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> steamed forward as if <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said nothing. “Just as chemical reactions are the deconstruction of molecular bonds, followed by their reconstruction albeit in different formations, so shalt I be. I shall emerge constituted in different patterns that yield different substances featuring different characteristic properties. Different magnitudes of potential bond energy! Alas, I will be a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis!” </p>
        
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“You’re mixing metaphors,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. “And maybe you’ll emerge as a tiger moth, with no mouth, doomed to no purpose but to flutter around and reproduce before you inevitably starve to death.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>  turned slowly and smiled at Winfield. “Biology is so inspirational. I mean, when there’s a will, there’s a way; am I right?”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Wrong,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. “But inspiration, as in cellular respiration, the blind diffusion of oxygen molecules that eventually bounce their way to an alien mitochondrion that shits out <span class="text-swap" id="atp-molecule"><span>ATP molecules</span></span>, is a pretty interesting idea.”
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Interest. Collecting interest. Compound interest.”
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Y’all,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah Bleu</span> said. “I can’t keep up.”
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> turned to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah </span> and smiled. 
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “That’s because you’re from Alabama, a re-tester, and should be incarcerated with all the other hypointels at the BeaverCreek EduCation Center. Plus, you’re high on all the guatama flower buds that <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="andrew-id">[Andrew] Ramblehurst </span> loaded you with.”
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="uriah-id">Uriah </span> grinned. “I’d like to inform all the folks streaming at home that GFBs are illegal due to their possession of a particular isomer of the TNT molecular compound. These [GFBs] which I’ve consumed <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="doublebond">are a different isomer</span>, which have – as of this date – not been explicitly declared illicit in any form whatsoever by these here federated states.”
           <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> thought-texted everyone a GIF of the TNT molecule (stick-and-ball model), with one of its double-bonds detached and swapping locales with a single bond part of the same ring. “Now that Uriah’s legal defense rests, I want to declare the possibility that I may eschew all ethical considerations and attempt to poison <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>  while he lays himself in the <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="dr-dalton-casket-ad">Dr. Dalton 3000 LucidDreamGlassCasket</span>. I’m thinking I could contaminate his medical IV bag with hungryHungryHeterotrophs.” 
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “Is that a threat?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>  asked.
         <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   “No, just a possibility. <i>PastMe</i> could never have predicted what <i>CurrentMe</i> is; why would <i>CurrentMe</i> be able to predict where <i>FutureMe</i> is?”
          <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “What about CurrentYou was obfuscated from the imagination of PastYou?” I asked.
         <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   “That I’d be a cyborg who [fooled] around all day and received prizes from NyleDroneBots as positive operant conditioning for allowing AutomaticAlgorithmicAdvisor apps to skew my daily behavior as some milestone of peak academic achievement.”
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    And then everyone roared with laughter so loud that <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="yeshi-deathshrine">Yeshi temporarily appeared inside Hector’s [death] shrine</span>.
