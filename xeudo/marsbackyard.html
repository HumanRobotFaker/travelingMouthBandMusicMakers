<h1> Mars' Backyard</h1>
        <hr><BR>

      
<p class="rightward"> The neighbourhood is nicer than yours. Big lots and big houses. </p>

<p class="rightward"> Andrew immediately exits the vehicle and approaches a gate for the wooden fence that encloses the backyard. He reaches over the top and lets himself in. You follow.</p>

<p class="rightward"> The backyard is exquisitely xeroscaped, with red clay tiles segmenting everything into tiny subsections featuring trees, plants, decorative rocks, and shrines.   </p>

<p class="rightward"> A middle-aged woman with long black hair leans forward, drawing a decrative pattern on a brick. The neckline of her blouse hangs, giving full view of her <I>ample</I> bosom. </p>

<p class="rightward">She looks up. "Hi Andrew. Mars just left."</p>

<p class="rightward">"She just left?" Andrew replies, and his eyes suddenly roll into the back of his head. Like he's seizuring. But then it stops and he just shakes his head.</p>

<p class="rightward">He turns to you.</p>

<p class="rightward">"Sorry</p>
