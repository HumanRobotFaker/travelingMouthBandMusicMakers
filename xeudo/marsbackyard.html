<h1> Mars' Backyard</h1>
        <hr><BR>

      
<p class="rightward"> The neighbourhood is nicer than yours. Big lots and big houses. </p>

<p class="rightward"> Andrew immediately exits the vehicle and approaches a gate for the wooden fence that encloses the backyard. He reaches over the top and lets himself in. You follow.</p>

<p class="rightward"> The backyard is exquisitely xeroscaped, with red clay tiles segmenting everything into tiny subsections featuring trees, plants, decorative rocks, and shrines.   </p>

<p class="rightward"> A middle-aged woman with long black hair leans forward, drawing a decrative pattern on a brick. The neckline of her blouse hangs, giving full view of her <I>ample</I> bosom. </p>

<p class="rightward">She looks up. "Hi Andrew. Mars just left."</p>

<p class="rightward">"She just left?" Andrew replies, and his eyes suddenly roll into the back of his head. Like he's seizuring. But then it stops and he just shakes his head.</p>

<p class="rightward">He turns to you.</p>

<p class="rightward">"Sorry. Unforseen detour. I'll be back," and Andrew 180s out the gate and closes it behind him.</p>

<p class="rightward">You stare at the closed gate, and then turn back around to the middle-aged woman. She continues leaning forward, drawing on a brick while her tits hang out.</p>

<p class="rightward">"So who are you? I haven't seen you before."</p>

<p class="rightward">"I'm Uriah Bleu," you say. "I just moved here. Like, last night."</p>

<p class="rightward">"<I>Last night?</I>" she says, looking up. "And you've already met Andrew?"</p>

<p class="rightward">"I went for a walk last night. And he was hanging out with Winfield and Mars in a driveway."</p>

<p class="rightward"> "A driveway, huh?"</p>

<p class="rightward">"Yeah, in FarmBrook. The neighbourhood where I live."</p>

<p class="rightward">"FarmBrook, huh?" she says, her tits <I>still</I> hanging out. </p>

<p class="rightward">"Yes, ma'am," you say.</p>

<p class="rightward">"Yes, <I>ma'am</I>?" she laughs. "You know how to make a lady feel <I>old</I>."</p>

<p class="rightward">"Sorry, ma'am. I'm from AMABALA. That's how we're trained to talk."</p>

<p class="rightward">"AMABALA, huh? What brings you all the way up to OIHO?"</p>

<p class="rightward">"My parents separated and my mom found a job at the AeroForce base."</p>

<p class="rightward">She blinks. You try hard not to stare at her tits.</p>
