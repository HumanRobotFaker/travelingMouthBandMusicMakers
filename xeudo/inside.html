<p class="rightward"> Andrew opens the door quietly and sneaks you into the house.  He walks you upstairs to a closed bedroom. He opens it slowly and then waltzes right in. You follow. </p>

<p class="rightward">"I have brought the Ignorance of Good & Evil," Andrew announces.

<p class="rightward">"Why thank you, great anti-serpent," the boy says.</p>

<p class="rightward">"Boiled meat," the girl says. "Do you know how to knock?" </p>

<p class="rightward"> Andrew shrugs his shoulder and hands out bottles of yeefass to everyone. "I just thought our new friend would like a free show."</p>

<p class="rightward"> The girl rolls her eyes. "Fine. Here I am," and she squeezed her breasts.</p>

<p class="rightward">You apologize. "I'm sorry. I was just following him."</p>

<p class="rightward">"Don't believe him, MarsBarCandyStar," Andrew said. "The whole ride to the petrol station, he just kept asking me questions about you. He's real thirsty for you. I tried to let her know that you were Winfield's woman, but he wouldn't let up."</p>

<p class="rightward">You look directly at Winfield. "That is <I>not</I> true."</p>

<p class="rightward">Winfield exhales a cloud of smoke. "Andy, quit being so messy."</p>

<p class="rightward">"I can't help it," Andy says. "I get so used to stirring up these intraPenguinConflicts that it's become second nature to me."</p>

<p class="rightward">The four of y'all drink the yeefass. Winfield turns on some music on his MOB.</p>

<p class="rightward">"What's this music?" you ask?</p>

<p class="rightward">"This band in OrnjSprings," Winfield says.</p>

<p class="rightward">"Where's that?"</p>

<p class="rightward">Andrew laughs. "Uriah here just got off <I>the boat</I>. He doesn't know <I>nothing</I>." He burps. "Excuse me. I meant, he just got off <I>the UHAUL</I>."  </p>

<p class="rightward"> Winfield gestured toward the northeast corner of the room. "It's like a half-hour drive thataway.</p>

<p class="rightward"> By the end of the second bottle, you're feeling drunk. It's strange. It's like you've been lobotomized and placed on a seat-warmer that just feels <I>good</I>. You lay down on the floor.</p>
