<p class="rightward"> "Are you sure you're okay to drive?" you ask. </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Drive?" the redhead said, pressing his thumbprint onto a sensor. "That's what robo-slaves are for." </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Yeah, but I'm pretty sure you still have to be — "</p>

<p class="rightward"> The redhead shushes you. The automobile loads up, and he puts in the destination coordinates.</p>

<p class="rightward"> "What's your name anyhow?"</p>

<p class="rightward"> The redhead smiles. "I am <i class="name">Andrew Ramblehurst</i>."</p>

<p class="rightward"> "I'm Uriah Bleu," you say.</p>

<p class="rightward"> "Please to meet you, creature of the night," and y'all shake hands.</p>

<p class="rightward"> At the petrol station, Andrew stayed in the truck while you went inside to buy the yeefass. The counter clerk looks quickly at this identification.</p>

<p class="rightward"> "AMABALA, huh?" he said. "What brings you here?" </p>

<p class="rightward"> You consider lying, but you decide to just blurt it out. </p>

<p class="rightward"> "My mom tricked me into going up to Dayton College. Apparently she's had a secret boyfriend with connections to the college's financial aid department, and she got me a scholarship so she would have an excuse to relocate up here with me." </p>

<p class="rightward"> The clerk looked bewildered. "Say what?"</p>

<p class="rightward"> "My mom was fukking this guy behind my dad's back. She groomed me to go to Dayton College, because it would relocate me near this guy who lives downtown. But I found out because she passed out drunk while texting him and I saw the messages on her MOB." </p>

<p class="rightward"> The clerk paused. "Does your mom know you know?"</p>

<p class="rightward"> "Kur yes, she does. I told my dad." </p>

<p class="rightward"> "You told your dad?" </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Of course, I did. What was I s'posed to do? Let him be cucked like a fool?" </p>

<p class="rightward"> The clerk shrugged his shoulders. "So how did your dad take it?" </p>

<p class="rightward"> You pause. "He went on a bender, [ingesting] anything he could get his hands on. He almost died." </p>

<p class="rightward"> The clerk nods. "Woah, man. Heavy." </p>

<p class="rightward">"It's alright. He's in rehab now."</p>

<p class="rightward">"Oh good."</p>

<p class="rightward">You nod. "Yep. Well, nice talking to you."</p>
