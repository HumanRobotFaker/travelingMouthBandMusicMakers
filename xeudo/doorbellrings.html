<h1> Doorbell Rings</h1>

<p class="rightward"> The door bell rings. </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Uriah, will you get it?" your mom asks, as she hangs up another piece of art.</p>

<p class="rightward"> You answer the door. </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Ah!" Andrew says. "I picked the right UHAUL."</p>

<p class="rightward">"Hey!"</p>

<p class="rightward">"How's the head? Hurting?"</p>

<p class="rightward">"No, I'm fine.</p>

<p class="rightward">"Great! Hey, I'm sure you're busy here, but do you wanna help out Mars with her backyard?"</p>

<p class="rightward">"Her backyard?"</p>

<p class="rightward">"Yeah, she's doing some strange esoteric Maniite nonsense. You ever heard of the Maniites?"</p>

<p class="rightward">"Of course I've heard of Maniites."</p>

<p class="rightward">Andrew shrugs his shoulders. "Didn't know how many they have down in AMABALA. It being a theocracy, and all."</p>

<p class="rightward">You laugh. "It's not a theocracy. Freedom of religion exists there too."</p>

<p class="rightward">"Whatever you say, boss. You wannna help? It might help you get into her pants once her and ole Winfield split up."</p>

<p class="rightward"> |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| <BR>||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||</p>

    <p class="rightward"> You hop in the truck and Andrew takes you a klik down the road. The two of you start to talk, but then Andrew suddenly takes a call on his MOB. He holds his finger to his ear. </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Yes?" Andrew said. "Good day to you too, Sri. Yes? Yes, I made efforts to perform the dreamscape-obliteration act." Pause. "No, it was <I>not</I>succesasful." Pause. "Well, I'm not sure. It's like I was lucid — and not lucid — at the same time.
 Pause. "Yes, Sri. I promise to try harder tonight."</p>

 <p class="rightward">Andrew drops his hand from his ear and turns to you. "Sorry about that."</p>

 <p class="rightward">"What was <I>that</I>?" you ask.</p>

  <p class="rightward">"That? Oh, that was nothing."</p>

   <p class="rightward">"Sure sounded like something."</p>

    <p class="rightward">Andrew exhaled loudly. "That was my spiritual advisor, Sri pHepL of Ulaanbaatar AILOGNOM. We are working on a lucid dream eduProjekt." </p>

 <p class="rightward">"Lucid Dream <I>eduProjekt</I>?"</p>

  <p class="rightward">Andrew throws a dismissive hand. "Don't worry about it. It's immaterial to our current goal:— getting you into the good graces of Mars Bellicose."</p>

   <p class="rightward">"Wait <I>what?</I> We just met. Why are you obsessed with getting me with Mars?"</p>

    <p class="rightward">Andrew shrugs his shoulders. "My Triple-A tells me to."</p>

     <p class="rightward">"Your <I>what?</I>"</p>

      <p class="rightward">"My automatic algorithmic advisor. I do whatever it tells me to do. It's a school thing."</p>

       <p class="rightward">"A school thing? What kind of school do you go to?"</p>
