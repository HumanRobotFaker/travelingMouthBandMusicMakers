 <p class="p2"> <B>Winfield Jones</B> was part of the PENGUION LIBERATION FRONT. Naturally, this meant he would be in league with Andrew Ramblehurst's revolutionary ambitions, even if he didn't wholly trust them.  </p> 

 <p class="p2"> "You're saying that Ahuramazda came to you in a vision, and told you to install a student democracy?"</p>

<p class="p2"> Andrew shrugged. "Well, not me, <I>personally</I>. Hector Chavez. He's in contact.</p>

<p class="p2"> "With Ahuramazda?"</p>
    
<p class="p2"> Andrew shrugged. "One of their yazatas, at least."</p>

<p class="p2"> "Maybe it's actually Ahriman." </p>

<p class="p2"> "Maybe." </p>

<p class="p2"> Winfield took Andrew into the back den. "Well, I got my own sources reaching through the veil that separates reality from cosmic existence. And they smear menses and faeces on the wall every crescent moon."  </p>

<p class="p2">"Stop," Andrew said.</p>

<p class="p2">"And from <I>my interpretation</I>, it would seem that the true solution is the complete ABOLITION of the antiquated concentration center."</p>

<p class="p2">"That's heresy," Andrew said.</p>

<p class="p2">"But why? Loretta is just as in touch with the cosmic divine than some lazy boy who sleeps all the time."</p>

<p class="p2">Andrew looked down at Winfield's older sister, as she drooled on a rubber chew toy, wearing nothing but a t-shirt and a saggy Depends™ diaper. </p>
