<h1> Outside</h1>
        <hr><BR>


<p class="rightward"> The neighbourhood, which was built twenty jaars prior, was installed with overhanging lights that nMever turn off. You don't like it. With such good lighting, you assume the wiki-cameras enable anyone in the community to watch you promenade, with facial recognition algos labeling you as an outsider. Your heard OIHO was like that. </p>

<p class="rightward">Nonetheless, you walk and explore the neighbourhood. Unsurprisingly, given that it's almost 24h00, you find most of the houses silent, and without life. </p>

<p class="rightward">But then, as you follow the sidewalk into a cul-de-sac, you hear the murmur of voices. There are people sitting in the back of a pickup. On approach, you realize they are teenagers. Drinking yeefass.</p>

<p class="rightward">"Woah, stranger of the night," the girl said. </p>

<p class="rightward">"Good evening," you say.</p>

<p class="rightward">"Who's this guy?" the black-haired male asks. A cigarette pisses smoke around him. "Did you just manifest from the nothingness?"</p>

<p class="rightward">"I literally just moved here from AMABALA," you say. "Like, we pulled the UHAUL into the driveway a few hours ago." </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Dude," the girl said. "You don't have to lie to us. We're cool with you manifesting from the nothingness."</p>

<p class="rightward"> "Unless you're a vampire," the black-haired male said. "Then we need to know. By Antarctic Law." </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Antarctic Law?" you ask.</p>

<p class="rightward">The redhead in the boy skout uniform raised a finger. "A more pertinent and time-sensitive question is: «how old are you?»</p>

<p class="rightward"> "I have 18 jaars," you say. </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Perfect," he says, finishing his aluminum can of yeefass. "Because OIHO law prohibits the sale of alcohol at petrol stations between the 01h00 and 06h00. As well as to those under the age of eighteen." And he hopped off the truck bed. "You two stay here and guardian the garrison." </p>

<p class="rightward"> "Aye, aye, generalissimo," the black-haired male says, dropping his cigarette to the concrete as he hops off the truck bed. The girl stands up and steps on it for him. </p>
