	We went to the skool fundraiser, and one band threw a guitar through the window and tried to persuade the crowd to rip up old books they’d saved from the Goodwill™ dumpster. Naturally, the band got the curb, the hook, the “get the kur outta here.” Naturally, I was intrigued and followed them out to the parking lot.
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Hey guys, do you need any help carrying your equipment?” I asked. “What you did in there was awesome! I’ve never seen anything like it. Except on [TV].”
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    They smiled and accepted my help. Openly, they discussed whether the yashawashi or the yashakashi had pointed their supernaturalMemoryRemover device on this community yet. The band settled on ‘yes’. The bassist quickly assembled a small brown box, which was labeled «Interdimensional Wave Transmission Kit», dropping some <mark class="mark4">[redacted by censor]</mark> before sealing it and leaving it at the door of the fundraiser.
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    They had an extra seat in the van.
	<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    So I hopped in and motored off to the next town.
   <BR><BR><BR>

    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “We got a gig in Cincinnati in someone’s randon-spewing basement, " the lead guitarist explained. We were there within an hour. 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    I tried to ask them questions about who they were or where they were from, but they just turned the questions around on me. <I>Who</I> was <u>I</u> and where was <U>I</U> <I>from</I>? So I told them my whole old narrative about divorced parents and growing up lax [EUB] until a venture into a [decentralist] middle skool turned me into a passionate defender of the european state and all of EUB history. Which I was <I>great</I> at –I was very talented at performing [EUB logic jiu jitsu] – but an atheist classmate of mine just kept emailing me a single, solitary picture of people lining up to kiss the [head principus of EUB]’s ring as he saw on a big gaudy bejeweled throne, wearing a suit of [Au-197]. And it just seemed so anti-thethical to how I understood yeshi to be. And so I stopped attending temple, and now I was reconsidering the necessity for believing in a supernatural yeshi. Or even life after death. Or Ahuramazda.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Heavy,” the bassist said. The lead guitarist reached into his satchel and handed me a postcard of a mongolian man surrounded by geometric cubes. “You should call sri pHepL; he’s helped all of us out.” 
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    I was willing to call right then and there, but nobody had a [MOB] on them, which I thought was strange but – then again – I myself did not have a [MOB] since my parents’d taken it away because they caught me playing pornographic video games. “Somebody will have a phone you can use in Cincinnati, surely,” the drummer said. In minutes, we pulled into a neighbourhood full of dilapidated homes, and full of hardened impoverished faces <I>hanging around</I>, and for a second I freaked out, but then we ended up in a slightly less scary neighbourhood. A long-haired dude in a neon-reflective vest and glowing flashlights directed the van into a gravel driveway that ran alongside a narrow three-story house.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    The guys left the gear in the van, as the drummer quickly found me a phone with which I could call the sri. “He always answers,” the drummer explained, as a stranger led us down a winding corridor up various mini-flights of stairs, until I was sat down in a glorified broom closet. “Here,” the stranger said, handing me a cord-tethered landline screwed to the wall.  The noise was loud from the band in the basement. And the voice on the other end of the phone was faint.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Hello?” I said loudly.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    A faint quibble responded.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Hello?” I said. “Can you speak louder?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “How can I help you, my son?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Friends told me to call you. They said you could help.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Help you with what, my son?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    I paused. I breathed. “Did yeshi have supernatural powers?”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Supernatural powers?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Yeah. Fly in the sky. Heal the blind. Raise from the dead.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“The limits that reality attempts to impose upon us can be overcome with disciplined practice.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“So you’re saying <I>’yes’?</I>”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“It’s possible.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Possible. But not certain.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I wasn’t there, my son.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“And, even if it <I>was</I> certain, you’re insinuating that it wouldn’t be <I>unique?</I>” I asked.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The voice spoke, but suddenly there was a swell of noise from the basement that blared out everything.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I’m sorry, can you speak louder? It’s very noisy here,” I said.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
But I couldn’t hear what the voice said next. 
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I’m so sorry, I can’t understand. It’s very loud.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Then the voice yelled. “DREAM DRAMA DISASSOCIATION!”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Okay, I hear that,” I said. “But what’s that mean ‘xactly?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
But as I said the final words, I realized the line had gone dead. I put the receiver down and then picked it back up, but there was no dial tone. So I pulled open the curtain.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Nobody was there. 
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
I left and tried to find my way through a maze of turns, steps, and tiny rooms. I quickly realized I was lost, but luckily one of the rooms had an inhabitant who sat on a couch underneath the illumination of an ornate, overarching floor lamp, reading a hardbound book the size of a 10,000-page divine anthology.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“My apologies for intruding,” I said. “But I do believe I am lost.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The inhabitant lowered his book on his lap. “In this neoliberal nightmare, dare I suggest that <I>anyone</I> isn’t lost? Drowning in this sea of crass materialism as it is.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
I hesitated. “I’m sorry, but I’m not very political.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The inhabitant scoffed with audible exhalation. “And that, my fellow human being, is a very <I>political</I> thing to say.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
I paused and waited. “If you don’t mind, could you direct me to the basement?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“But alas! The basement had already been found! What with Marx, that shoddy mathematician, miscalculating the value of mechanization and not seeing how containerships could circumnavigate any worker collective’s demands for rights and protections because the lumpenproletariat – and the workers themselves – would be enchanted by a sudden specious surge in spending power thanks to imported cheap goods hastily assembled by some coolie economically displaced from some rural <I>nowhere</I>.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“So…. where is the basement?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“The basement is the total replacement of the human labour force with AI-assisted mechs, culminating in the gradual sterilization of those on the left of the bell curve. Or maybe they’ll use CRISPR-CAS9 to implant nano-cyborg DNA as some sort of fusion, whilst the capital-carrying class live on some perverse garden of terrestrial delights, laughing uproariously in hedonic debauchery.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
By this point, the amplitude of the inhabitant’s voice rose higher and higher, as I edged myself backwards, suddenly certain that the path to the music was probably not thru <I>that</I> room.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
Like a blind man, I groped the walls and sides of furniture, hoping my intuition coupled with muscle memory would guide me to the correct path downstairs. And it seemed to work, as I kept traveling thru orifices that led me to take half-a-dozen steps downwards here, a half-a-dozen steps downward there, until I found myself in a crowded kitchen of twenty-somethings. A burly guy in a UIC sweater emerged from an open fridge with five brown bottles of yeefass in each paw. 
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Free Lobotomy Bock beer,” the guy announced. “Brought to you by the Black Ocean Parking Lots.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The guy passed out the yeefass to everybody, including myself.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I just saw those guys in Dayton,” I told the dude. “I hopped into their van and traveled with them to this party.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Cool,” he said.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“How do you know them?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“I don’t. They just gave me a couple of six-packs and told me to pass the rest out.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“You go to UIC?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Yeah.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“You [EUB]?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
He sneered. “Fukk no,” and then he turned and left the room.
<BR><BR><BR>
    <BR><BR><BR>
I drank the yee and stood around the crowd, listening to them discuss restaurants and bands I didn’t know. I wrote names down on this lil’ notebook I carried in my back hip pocket. Someone told me how to get to the basement, so I followed the directions and arrived.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The band was on the stage already, which surprised me, but I was even more surprised when they said,” thanks for having us tonight; our last song we’re required to play by contractual obligation.” A couple girls cheered and the drummer pulled a string that caused a banner to unfurl that read OLIVE GARDEN and the lead guitarist started tossing out gift cards and shoving breadsticks in people’s mouths while the rest of the band played the song. The basement had a dozen people, but only a handful were actually paying attention. When the song was over, the attendees clapped and the band unplugged their instruments.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“You guys going to Louisville next?” a girl asked the bassist.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Nashville,” he said.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Nashville? Skipping over Louisville?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The bassist shrugged. “We play three gigs there <I>tomorrow</I>.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Whaaaat? What’s going on in Nashville tomorrow?”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“Some sort of festival at [redacted by legal request]. People gonna be partying all day.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
The band took their equipment to the van and finished their yeefass.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
“You coming to Tennessee with us?” the drummer asked.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
And I had to make a decision. So I climbed into the van.
