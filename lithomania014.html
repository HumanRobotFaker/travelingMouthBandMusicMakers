        Khali and Hector had a strange friendship.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        It started as a lark: Hector was in her bedroom (with a whole group of other people), and he started examining her bookshelf. She actually read books, so he saw some good ones that he’d already read or wanted to read. Then he pulled out a strange-looking one.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     
        “Stop,” Khali said.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      
        “What?” Hector said.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     
        No one else was paying much attention to them. She whispered, “That’s my diary.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    
        “Let me read it,” Hector said.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
        “No.”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
        “You can trust me. Have I done anything to betray your trust?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        Khali knew that Hector knew that Khali still met up with [his wrestling buddy], even though she was currently the “girlfriend” of a naive boy in the room. 
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “Okay,” she said. “But if you betray me, I’ll kill myself.”
