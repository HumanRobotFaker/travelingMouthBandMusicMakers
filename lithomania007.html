    “What are you building?” Luuk asked.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “A rock wall,” Andrew said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Obviously,” Luuk said. “But I imagined you were making a straight line. These are like little pens.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Jakob spoke. “We are building an altar to the almighty lithoDeity, who forged our planet through brute force and mass.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    “Oh?” Luuk said.
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
    Andrew stopped and smiled. “If we don’t pay proper wor[th]ship to the lithoDeity, they will smash us into un[w]hol[l]y bits.”
    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

        <h1>          :: .09 :: </h1>
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Andrew and Jakob began wearing [cervidae] animal hides. Hector went to sleep. He’d just concluded some insane sleep schedule that went as followed:

            <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                And now was the time to sleep for 23-straight hours again.
                <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
“He believes he’ll find «the ultimate meaning of existence»,” Andrew explained.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
“I thought he already found that with TheHole™?” Jakob said. 
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
“He doesn’t believe the letter is real,” Andrew said. “He doesn’t see how the letter could answer «the ultimate meaning of existence». He thinks I forged the letter.”
