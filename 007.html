        Hector took me to a concert near the University of Dayton, where they wrapped our wrists with fourteen flourescent-green paper bands and sharpied giant X's all over our hands to ensure we didn't underage drink. There was a touring band Hector wanted to see, a band recommended by his brother Brazil who lived in West Tejas (and often traveled to Austin TJ to see hip bands and avant-garde art). 
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        The band in question opened the show and we drank sodas as we stood amongst a couple dozen other people, fairly spaced out. Hector watched with unbreaking gaze, and against myself, I found it - and him - cute. I looked around to see if I could find a cuter girl, but nobody caught my eye. The band was okay. Typical drums, two guitars, and a bass guitar fodder. Occasionally, a guy would bang on a keyboard. But Hector thought they were geniuses. He liked their cheeky anti-love love songs and was especially enamored by their costume changes coupled with a narrative yarning with which they thread all their songs together in a semi-coherent package. 
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Damm, that was great," Hector said. He had blue pop rocks smeared on his lips and tongue. The band'd distributed the candies with small cups of cola, claiming it would give us a sensory experience akin to being sucked down a black hole.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Do you wanna go to temple with me?" Hector said.
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Wait, what? Why?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        He shrugged. "I thought you'd be interested."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "I've been to a yeshian temple before."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Universal European Bevy?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "No. But -"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "But what?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "I'm not converting to yeshianism."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Hector laughed. "I'm not trying to convert you. I just thought you'd be interested."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Interested?"
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "And I like being around you."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        I leaned over to Hector and whisper-yelled into his ear. "I'm a lesbian."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Hector flinched, but tried to flow into laughter. "I wasn't <I>hitting on you</I>; I stand by my previous statement. I like being around you and just wondered if you'd attend with me. No pressure."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Alright," I said. I punched him in the shoulder. "I'll go."
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        "Great," he said with his bright blue lips and tongue. "You'll be a proper yeshian in no time!"
