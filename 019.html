            Thanks to the ubiquity of municipally-operated wikiCameras, the prevalence of AV still+move frames made it more than possible for machineLearning softward to create photos and videos of anyone alive doing absolutely anything at all. Thus, when my father received a mailed envelope of my mother performing <span class = "censored"><I>indecent acts</I></span> with a man in our front yard, his first instinct was that this was a product of psychological warfare performed by a foreign gov't (or acteur). After all, my father developed autonomous AI self-repair systems for solar-powered drones so they could stay permanently in flight. And, thus, consequently, it might be a worthwhile pursuit to throw a stick into the spokes of his mental bicycle.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            But something about the <I>absurdity</I> of it - the front yard rather than a nondescript hotel room - made him question the <I>non</I>veracity of it. So he showed the photos to mother and she immediately broke down in confession.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            My parents, 'mazda bless 'em, didn't totally self-destruct in the aftermath. The only reason that <I>I</I> even knew it happened was that - for a hot moment - I was a snoop, a spy, a radical provocateur in favour of the absolute unveiling of all secrets that lay in the shadows. A force accelerating culture toward The Total Trust Society. But then, suddenly burrowed underneath the surface of the parental-provided narrative of our family's <I>histoire</I>, I faced the decision of what to do with that information. Put it on a billboard? Confront my parents? And in the end, I did what most common people probably do: pretend I knew nothing new and did nothing new except look at my parents' relationship through a new lens. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Except I told Hector. Because Hector was my transectional TTS™ buddy at the time. Albeit, I told him not to tell anyone.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Doesn't that violate the whole ideology of TTS™?" he asked. "Us keeping secrets from others?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            Hector, in the past, had already aired all his parents' dirty laundry.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "Maybe we're confused," I said. "I mean, the solshine doesn't radiate upon every square meter of terra perpetually. There's a time for illumination and there's an equally long period of darkness."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            He smirked. "On average. It's not equal right now. And the ratio changes on the <I>daily</I>."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            I rolled my eyes. "Okay, but you get the point."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "That you're backpedaling?" he said. "When did this all happen?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "When my brother and I were real little. Toddlers."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "And your dad <I>forgave</I> her?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            I shrugged. "All I know is what was on the old laptop [I found shoved in my dad's closet]." Then I explained how my dad had deleted the files, but I'd used an AI Archaeologist specifically trained to target «deleted» files. "There's a journal entry on a text file where he basically 'xplained everything. The guy was some old boyfriend of hers that happened to be in the near proximity for work. My dad basically blamed himself for inattention whilst noting her postpartum depression. I know there's more to the story, but all I got is a deleted [text-message exhchange] conversation he had with a friend where he says that his father gave him some advice for relationship-repair and they seemed to be working things out. And then that's it. Then it blipped out of the written record."
