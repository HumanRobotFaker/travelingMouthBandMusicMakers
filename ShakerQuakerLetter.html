            If one drops a rock from a simple meter above its natural resting place, the rock will make an impression upon the earth. But if one drops that very same rock from four meters above its natural resting place, then the rock will make a greater impression upon the earth.  <BR><BR>
                Gabriella is that rock. An ordinary rock. Only she was lifted to the height of the clouds, released, and created such an impression on the earth that she burrowed so deeply into the earth that no one could retract her from it. <BR><BR>
                Much akin to this hollowed-out stone that you’ve found.<BR><BR>
                This writer enjoys the fanciful thought of who might find this stone. Men of science write whimsies that the common man will be transmogrified into a creature with minuscule water-wheels inside his every cell, so that energy will no longer need be acquired by the airs and transported through the bloods. How these “water wheels” will be constructed is unimaginable, but purportedly it is a necessity if human beings ever wish to settle the lands on the moons and the distant planets. Perhaps it will not be found by humanity at all, but by creatures who formed on distant planets that encircle distant stars. Ones who will stare confoundedly at this bizarre smearing of ink atop the reassembled parts of massacred plants.But perhaps even they will find a Rosetta Stone to help them decipher the meanings behind my plodding assemblage of symbolic thought.<BR><BR>
                Although, most certainly, these piece of paper will become rot, eaten by the invisible tiny animals that populate the airs, despite all my efforts to make these papers indigestible to such creatures.<BR><BR>
                Nonetheless, let me introduce myself: I am Spenta Vohu, eldest sibling of my dear sister Gabriella Vohu, who many affectionately refer to as Generous Gabby (which is ironic because she is neither generative in the biological sense nor a proponent of gentry). Nonetheless, in a more superficial sense, she is generous because she gives all her efforts and material goods to others with purportedly no reasonable limitation.<BR><BR>
                I write these words on a community of farms established beside the Beaver Creek in the Northwest Territories. Gabriella is rarely here, but she is the reason these communities exist. Without her, there would be something else entirely here.<BR><BR>
                So how did Gabriella’s impression reach here? How did her falling self make such an impact on the earth? It began as boring tale with her as a character impossible to differentiate from any other maiden. If her uterus would have simply held the children she and her husband created, there would be no tale worth telling. If her uterus would have held the child in the placenta and properly nourished it until the appropriate time for birthing, none of this would have happened. But it did not. Over and over again, the children in her womb were expelled unready to survive on their own in this world. Gabriella told me the final attempt featured an offspring so malformed that its monstrosity rang the bell in her soul that to continue trying was the fight Ahuramazda Himself. 
                Considering death’s incessant attack on life, all cultures feel a compulsion to breed. To resist or to fail at this is to invite death into our hearts, which shudders at the serious consideration of our earthly extinguishment. 
                <BR><BR>
                My sole daughter, after only a few revolutions around Sol, became unconvinced of society’s stories about eternal afterlives. I, being a freethinker, eschewed my paternal duty to assure her that death was only a mirage because I myself am not certain that it is, in fact, a mirage. I am also not certain it is not a mirage. Nonetheless, my daughter — in the midst of the night or in the midst of the day — would be overcome with the terror that one day she would die. That one day, she would no longer exist, that she would simply be absorbed in the body of another and turned into soil. She took no solace from the idea that men of science viewed energy as eternal and impossible to extinguish, thus, in a manner, she would live forever, albeit disintegrated. No answer or verbal trickery on my part could calm her agitated soul; at best, I learned to redirect her attentions to more enjoyable pursuits, such as wandering to unknown yet nearby places, surprising ourselves in the discovery of something simple yet unexpected: a frog on a stone, a snake in the grass, a strange formation in the bark of a tree. We stood in the creek, moving rocks and building dams, causing the gentle water to suddenly bubble and twist violently.<BR><BR>
                Gabriella faced that same terror, only she could not be so easily distracted. Instead, she yelled and screamed at Ahuramazda throughout the night. She sent her husband away and scratched at his face if he attempted to return. Then she began to do what few sane individuals attempt to do: she attempted to read all ten thousand pages of the Divine Anthology. Somewhere amidst the three hundredth page, with the fourth retelling of Shamshoun, Gabriella skipped to the most highlighted section of text in our modern society: the seven tellings of Yeshi. <BR><BR>
                Through the lens of her abject misery, Gabriella saw the tale of Yeshi from new angles. She pondered upon and seriously considered sections of text that are rarely emphasized by the oral transmitters in the temple. With ten thousand pages of text, why was only a small fraction considered worthy for oral transmission? <BR><BR>
                Furthermore, what she found most frustrating were the writers themselves. They would recount a tale Yeshi told. The tale would end. One writer would simply leave it there. Another writer would have the nerve to claim that Yeshi immediately took the mystery of his tale and ruined it with a pedestrian meaning — one that often made no sense to one closely considering the details of the tale Yeshi told.<BR><BR>
                But most importantly for ones with interest in Gabriella and the movement she spawned, she became most obsessed with the impressive gulf that separates the life Yeshi lived with the lives that yeshians lived. Yeshi was a celibate pacifist, who owned nothing and shared everything in common. Considering the term “yeshian” means “little yeshi”, shan’t yeshians act likewise?
                So Gabriella decided to act likewise. And she convinced others to act likewise.<BR><BR>
                ————————-<BR><BR>
                What is this thing we call life? I woke up at dawn and paced through the woods that border the community’s property. I spied birds, flitting this way and that way. It is spring, so some of this flitting involves scraping insects from the earth and redepositing them into their aviary gullets, but some of this flitting involves brightly colored males chasing duller colored females. Food, reproduction, fear of predation… what am I missing? <BR><BR>
                A friend of mine from Pittsburgh who amassed a personal collection of tamed zoological creatures — he informed me that the metabolic system of birds is so demanding that they must constantly eat. Their very biological nature imprisons them to certain activities, like a scriptwriter controlling the thoughts and speech of an actor.<BR><BR>
                How much of our humanly existence is likewise?<BR><BR>
                So much efforts are certainly devoted toward the production, preservation, and transport of foodstuffs. We wage war on the wilderness in the process, because the wilderness does not care for our humanly plans for the future. The burrowing vole wishes to eat the roots of our plants, the flying crow wishes to eat the fruits, and tiny insects try to devour the leaves. Disease, in the form of invisible airborne minuscule animals, seeks to devour anything it can. So we design devices to dissuade them, we outright murder them, and we try to keep it all for ourselves. That is agriculture and whilst my sister’s community of celibate pacifists might pretend to be divorced from this violence (because they don’t dine directly on animal flesh), they are blinding themselves from the brutality of it all. Perhaps it is due to a lack of imagination or an unwillingness to open one’s circle of compassion to the infinite degree.<BR><BR>
                Simple-minded dullards, most of my sister’s clan are.<BR><BR>
                —————- <BR><BR>
                Last autumn, my daughter collected one of these strange hairy caterpillars that climbed all over the trees. She plunked it in the glass jar and build a little home, as she’d seen in the past from my zookeeper friend. Through the mails, I purchased a book on insects because the seller promised me a small section on this particular type of caterpillar, which he referred to as a “wooly mammoth”. The book provided much interesting information about the strange lives of these tiny boneless creatures. <BR><BR>
                According to the newly purchased texts, our newly captured friend had a bizarre fate set before him: he would one day spin himself into a chrysalis akin to a butterfly, before emerging in total transmogrification as a creature commonly referred to as a “tiger moth”. This metaphor of change is a common device for the oral transmitters at the temple: from once a crawling wretch, to a death-like state, before emerging as a lovely nearly-unrecognizable creature capable of flight and pollinating all our lovely angiosperms. A strange note about the emergent tiger moth: they have no mouth, so all they can do is find a mate to sexually reproduce before they suffer the inevitable end: starvation. If they avoid predation, of course.<BR><BR>
                My daughter, of course, wailed at the thought of this inevitable outcome. For her newly captured pet, for herself, for everyone.
                One day, the wooly mammoth caterpillar climbed on a stick, stopped, and wove itself into a chrysalis. <BR><BR>
                So we waited.<BR><BR>
                And waited.<BR><BR>
                And then one day, I looked into that glass jar and found… a fly. And a hole in the chrysalis. I removed the lid of the jar and shooed the fly away, confused about how it had gotten inside the jar. Had the fly tried to predate the chrysalis and created that hole trying to get in?<BR><BR>
                I waited for my daughter’s pet to emerge as a tiger moth, but nothing happened for days. My daughter didn’t notice the hole.
                I wrote to a friend and they wrote back.<BR><BR>
                “I am sorry to say that it appears your daughter’s wooly mammoth caterpillar is no longer a living creature in our world. Many insects, as part of their normal pattern of reproduction will parasitically lay their eggs directly into the flesh of a living creature. This probably happened to your daughter’s pet before she obtained it. The eggs lay dormant until they don’t. This possibly spurned the chrysalis creation — plants under duress will prematurely blossom in attempt to successfully reproduce despite unfavorable circumstances. Nevertheless, I hate to write it, but it seems that the parasitic fly larva devoured your daughter’s pet from the inside, using it as food like yolk in a fowl egg.”<BR><BR>
                I decided to burn that letter and never tell my daughter.<BR><BR>
                Eventually, she grew curious about the long dormant state of her pet. She noticed the hole and decided, after not finding the pet under foliage, that it had somehow escaped and flew away.<BR><BR>
                I let her believe this.<BR><BR>
                She pushed for an investigation of the chrysalis. I cut it open and found an empty tomb. Yes, my daughter, he miraculously escaped and flew away.<BR><BR>
                ———————-<BR><BR>
                To attend a weekly veneration in my sister’s community is to be surrounded by squawking birds, all singing different tunes, in total cacophony. <BR><BR>
                This is symbolic of ultra-egalitarianism, where no frequency tone is paramount nor must one be forced into a corresponding frequency station in the pursuit of “harmony”. So you have what I think to be symbolic of everything: a palimpsest of incongruities.
                There is squawking and shaking and wild movement. Then there is silence. Total silence. <BR><BR>
                Then one-by-one, individuals depart on their own accord.<BR><BR>
                ———————-<BR><BR>
                I liked to be the last one to leave the room. The last one sitting silently. This tendency caused consternation amongst the congregation. After all, was I attempting to instill a sense of spiritual superiority to separate myself from the rest of the community? I was not. I was simply following the little light inside of me, which commanded that I do thus.<BR><BR>
                Nonetheless, the elders met with me. “Brother, your adherence to this practice of being the last one out — we fear it is an attachment and lust for worldly recognition.”<BR><BR>
                “Thank you, Brother, for seriously considering my spiritual state. I will henceforth break the habit so as not to improperly elevate myself in the minds of the naive and new.”<BR><BR>
                So I stopped attending the weekly veneration. Because that is what the little light inside of me said to do. The thought of walking into that building, after they had declared my practices to be antithetical to the community, made me feel like my soul was a domicile for the furies. I walked by the creek and followed where the water went, which was eastward. <BR><BR>
                I walked for hours. The thought of just wandering off with no forethought certainly appealed to my juvenile nature. Eventually, a landowner noticed my plain clothes person far from my community.<BR><BR>
                “Where you headed, ShakerQuaker?” <BR><BR>
                I stopped and turned. “I am following the creek to see where it goes.”<BR><BR>
                The man laughed and shifted his footing. “Well, about 20 kilometers that way, it joins into the Little Miami River. Then it flows all the way down to the Oiho River, just east of Cincinnati. And then the Oiho river eventually flows into the Mississippi River. And then the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico.”<BR><BR>
                “Well, I suppose I can stop walking.”<BR><BR>
                This made the man laugh. “So what’s going on? Tired of the celibate life?”<BR><BR>
                “There are benefits for eschewing the cerebral machinations that ceaselessly seek to satiate one’s self through devices of pleasure.”<BR><BR>
                “Well, I suppose that’s true. I grew up in the European Universalism, so that’s what they claimed about the TempleMasters. That their minds were capable of conceiving the divine since they weren’t filled to capacity with the noise of vulgar mundane living.” He spat tobacco onto the ground. “Kur, maybe it isn’t total nonsense. But y’all are fooling yourselves if you think the entire community can live like that.”<BR><BR>
                “Existence is mysterious. Who knows what is possible?”<BR><BR>
                “Indeed. It certainly is a strangeness, this being alive, that we allow to be dissolved by the day-to-day rain of everyday living. But I wouldn’t wager that y’all’ll be able to last in perpetuity like the other sub-sects.”<BR><BR>
                “Unfortunately, there is nowhere to wager on such things, so your speculation cannot bring you great fortune if you are correct.”
                The man laughed. “I don’t know if you’re allowed to, but would you like to step inside for coffee or tea?”<BR><BR>
                Coffee and tea are luxury products that depend upon feudalism and slavery to achieve their economic goals. But alas, I had just been chastised for separating myself speciously in a scheme of supposed spiritual superiority. <BR><BR>
                “I will not deny myself communion with you,” I said. And followed the man into his domicile. <BR><BR>
                We sat at his kitchen table, as he emptied a bag of tiny red cherries into a shallow dish. Our fingertips ripped the flesh off the pits and I thought about all the slaves or serfs or destitute workers in far off lands, thinking about their running their fingers on the plants themselves, ripping the fruit from the stems. My fingertips touching what their fingertips touched. <BR><BR>
                “If you’d’ve visited just a week ago, we could have skipped this part of the process.”<BR><BR>
                “Only the pits?”<BR><BR>
                “Apparently there’s this arboreal creature that eats the cherries whole and doesn’t digest the pits.” The man shrugged his shoulders. “It had amazing flavor.”<BR><BR>
                When we’d finished de-pitting the cherries, he tossed the flesh into a container full of broken chicken-egg shells. Then he piled the pits into a mortar and then began crushing it with a pestle. <BR><BR>
                “How’d you get involved in that community of yours?” he asked.<BR><BR>
                “My sister is the founder.”<BR><BR>
                “Really? Of this particular community or the entire lineage of communities?”<BR><BR>
                “The entire thing. But I mean, she’s not the first to envision actually living the way Yeshi lived.”<BR><BR>
                “You think Yeshi wanted to live in sex-segregated communities that isolated themselves from the rest of the world? That’s not how I read the Divine Anthology.”<BR><BR>
                I rubbed my face in exhaustion, as the man poured the crushed pit powder atop a small muslin cloth. He lifted the corners of the cloth, brought them together, and then counter twisted it all into a nice package.Then he adeptly tied it nice and secure in twine.<BR><BR>
                “The way I read the Divine Anthology,” I said,” — and this isn’t how my sister would describe it, mind you, — it is a story of suicide.”<BR><BR>
                The man stopped. “Excuse me?”<BR><BR>
                I took his large glass jar and walked to the fireplace, where a cauldron of water was boiling.  I ladled the water into the glass jar and returned to the table. <BR><BR>
                “In the six non-aberrant versions of the Yeshi tales, Yeshi voluntarily walks into the giant cauldron of boiling water,” and I took the muslin package of ground coffee pits and dropped it into the large jar of steaming water. “Now, we as yeshians have been encouraged by our temple transmitters to not view this act as suicide — after all, is it really suicide to march to your death when the only other option is to be dragged to it?”<BR><BR>
                “I would argue not.”<BR><BR>
                “What have we been encouraged to take from this monstrous murder of Ahuramazda incarnate? We’re supposed to believe that Yeshi’s divinity bled and diffused much like is happening in this jar,” and I pointed to the water, which was slowly being corrupted into the opaque brownness.“But while there is a finite amount of molecules of coffee, Yeshi’s divinity is supposed to be infinite.”
                “Yes, sir.”<BR><BR>
                “But I think not.”<BR><BR>
                “You think yeshi’s divinity is finite?”<BR><BR>
                “I think the idea of divinity is defined by its opposite: the idea of non-divinity. But this dichotomization of matter within the world: that which is divine and that which is non-divine, seems to be specious and silly. Seems to be nonsense.”<BR><BR>
                “So all is divine or all is not divine?”<BR><BR>
                “I think there is no separation. But if all is divine, doesn’t the very definition of divinity cease to exist?”<BR><BR>
                The man shrugged his shoulders. He used a spoon to move around the tiny bag, whose contents were being separated by that which dissolved in water being able to seep out the porous muslin cloth and that which wouldn’t dissolve and thus lay imprisoned within the cloth package. “As a European Universalist, I was taught that evil didn’t actually exist. That it was simply a manifestation of an extreme lack of the good. That it could be akin to an archery competition established by Ahuramazda, who has commanded   </span><BR><BR>
