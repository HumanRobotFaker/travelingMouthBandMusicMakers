            Believe it or not, Uriah had never seen a [retard] before. How is a modern mystery, but the reality was plain to see written across his face as he gawked at Winfield's older sister, as she sprawled out on the floor, rolling tactile dice and ripping off strips of ducttape that she stuck to the floor.

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 

            "What is she doing?" Uriah asked. 
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "She's rolling dice and tallying the numbers," Winfield said. "See: she rolls the dice, feels the numbers on top, and then rips off the strips of duct tape to tally them on the floor."

            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Uriah looked at the sea of silver tallies covering the floors and walls of the room.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Yeah..." Uriah said. "But <I>why?</I>"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Same reason you fap to step-sister pohrn:- because she <I>likes it</I>," and he smacked Uriah on the back.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "I do <I>not</I> watch that stuff," Uriah began to say, but he stopped as he watched Winfield's eyeballs twitch as he stared off at nothing with a[n] [a]mused expression across his face.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "What's up?" Uriah asked.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Winfield's gaze returned to reality. "Nothing," he said. "Just a thought text. About an eduProjekt. Official TMB business."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Oh?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Winfield threw a dismissive hand. "Don't worry about it. It's hard to explain. These eduProjekts are like a tangled forest of Venn Diagram circle. It's hard to know where one begns and another ends."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            <I>Ripppppp....</I> Loretta, that eyeless, drooling, deaf-blind <span class ="censored">[redacted]</span>, tore off a stretch of tape with the help of her teeth. Then she adhered the tape to the floor, counting the strips with her hands.
