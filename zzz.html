       const text = "Mars Bar, <BR><BR> Greetings from lower Alabama. My mother has called my MOB thirteen times already, curious and worried about my father. Has he done anything erratic yet? Did he take me to Richard and drop me off in the middle of their downtown? Has he taken me into an automobile and driven due west for sixteen straight hours until we are in the west Tejas desert with Hector's big brother, shooting two-liter soda rockets into the heavens, while a giant bunny lays around in an opioid bliss? <BR><BR> No, Mom. Dad is behaving himself. <BR><BR> My mother is the one with the heavy rural accent. Daddy's accent is subtle; Mom's accent is like a lawnmower, so loud that it's impossible to ignore. She should have known that something was wrong with Daddy: he was from old money, aristocratic gentry with numerous cousins and kin and grandparents given ceremonial incestuous awards such as KING OF MARDI GRAS, that goofy pseudo-yeshian holyday, where one celebrates the coming resurrection and revival of yeshi himself, where one celebrates the coming by fasting and refraining from terrestial delights, and what best way to prepare for such a holy month of austerity? What best way other than to get drunk on yeefass, wear bizarre costumes, and engage in hedonistic debauchery in disguised masks? Anyhow, Daddy was a blue-blood in this bizarre culture, and he eschewed the privileges of breeding with so-and-so's sister-in-law, staying in the custom of only dating «the right kind of people from the right kind of ancestry» by getting with my country bumpkin of a mother. Not that my mother is really a country bumpkin. But she is from the sticks, the rural nowhere of fallow soil outside the black belt, and she can be first in her class, academically, but she still is first in class with a bunch of rednecks, hillbillies, waving that obsolete flag of a failed nation-state long dead and conquered. But she looked through the red flags, saw them with rose-coloured lenses, and thought: wow, it would be nice to actually not worry about money for a change. Alas, money was still something to worry about. How to maintain the familial relationships that ensure the money continues to flow. That the right professional relationships continue to flourish. How not to anger so-and-so, leading to a cascading dominos of effects, until everything is an absolute mess. And she watched her husband, the father of her two children (of which I am the eldest, in case you don't recall), totally collapse into drunken folly, raising his voice at politic dinners, declaring loudly and proudly all the dirty business that respectable society would prefer to go unspoken. «Yes, yes, Herschel, we know slavery was a basis for our wealth, but we could have long squandered that wealth over the decades since abolition if we weren't truly special people, if we were merely buffoon hacks who happened to stumble into the dominant position on the human heirarchy. Our people are special, Herschel.» But Herschel, my daddy, he'd just laugh and laugh and bang the table with his fist, and order another round of whiskey. <BR><BR> Not that I remember this, of course. <BR><BR> But what I do recall is being six jaars old when my parents divorced. My mother tried to make it respectable, asking Herschel daddy to please leave the house, please live in an apartment nearby. So Daddy rented an apartment against the wishes of his divorce attorney (never leave the family property and be possibly misinterpreted as «abandoning the family»), but little did Mama know that Daddy had rented a SECOND apartment, this one in the hood, in Richard, which was 92% black, many of the population stemming from freed slaves from Affrikka, who were prosperous and happening, until a highway needed to be built (according to the powers), and that highway happened to need to be built <I>right through the heart</I> of the black-skinned downtown.";
