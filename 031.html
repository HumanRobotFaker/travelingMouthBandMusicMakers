           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           Just like Hector, Brazil possessed a deceptively open-book style of conversation that lured you into believing that he hid nothing. He quickly told me that he’d returned from a drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation center in south Fleuritta. “I just got caught in a broken record groove loop, doing the same cycle of behaviour over and over again :- wake up, do the work and all the necessary stuff, and then when night falls, I obliterate my consciousness into nothingness. Obliterated. Fell. Past tense.”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “You clean?” I asked.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “Yeah,” he said. “I mean, I dunno, I mean all these rehab places are hypocrisy centers, talkin’ ‘bout addiction personified / anthropomorphized like Ahriman sittin' next door, plotting endless schemes to enslave us, and then we say ‘great meeting’ and go outside to smoke ten thousand cigarillos. I mean, it makes no sense.” And Brazil unpocketed a pack of smokes. “So, you know, I’m burnin’ through these like wildfire,” and he pulled out a cigarillo and threw the filter ‘twixt his lips.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “I imagine it’s hard to quit everything all at once,” I said.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           He shrugged. “Yeah, I mean, it’s easier in some ways especially if you’re snatched up by a giant claw and dropped off into some remote location where you never leave the premises.” Brazil took out the cigarillo and wave it at me. “You mind?”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “It’s your house,” I said.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “Well, not really,” he said. “Not anymore,” and he pulled out a double-rock gas tube combustion sustainer and torched the unfiltered side of the paper cylinder.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “How come you don’t e-vaporize?” I asked.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           He inhaled smokey colloids and then exhaled. Then he stared at the burning cigarillo as it pissed smoke into the atmosphere. “This? I guess I just like the fire aspect of it. Something primordial about it. Connects me to nature.”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “Nature,” I said.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           He shrugged his shoulders and made a facial expression that reminded me of Hector. “Yeah, yeah, I know. A bunch of [faeces], justifying rationales after-the-fact for insanely rooted axioms underlying stereotypic behaviour.” He puffed the cig again, drawing the gaseous cloud into his lungs, alveoli, bloodstream, redBloodCell-ridin’ hemoglobin with the pressure-gradient force and then relaxed his diaphragm muscle, exhaling. “How’s my brother doin’? Hector?”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “He sleeps a lot,” I said.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           Brazil shook his head and smirked. “That lucid dream cult. He wrote me about it. Still dialing’ up Doctor Dalton’s cronies?”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “Yeah, I think so.”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “Where’s he now? Sleeping underneath the floor below us in the basement raised crawl space?”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “I don’t know. I’m not wearing my iContacts™. I presume he’s in the woods, sleeping in a tent. He likes doing that. Or he’s with our [peers] or wrestling. He does those things too.”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           “That’s how you know mi hermano? Escuela?”
           
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           I nodded. “We read together, play chess, and talk religion and stuff.
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
           Brazil rubbed his hand on his head and pointed at my buzzed hair. “You some sort of ascetic?”
           
           <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
           
            I paused. “Yes,” I lied.
