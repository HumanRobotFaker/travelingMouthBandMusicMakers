            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> hung out with <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="me-id">me</span> the day before he inserted himself into the glass coffin, an act that has >widely been criticized as being <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="dr-dalton-casket">“self-indulgent and derivative”</span>. His demeanor could be described as maic and enthused. Oh what great wonders and wisdom he’d encounter upon his medically-induced multi-week foray into the LucidDreamRealmTM! Nevermind (and certainly not discuss) the aspect that this <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="physics">motivation</span> toward self-obliteration – temporary as it may be – was precipitated by the break-up of his relationship with Britni Lyn Sheba. Ahuramazda had destined this emulation of Dr. Dalton so Hector could ascend to TheNextLevel of his transformation into the UltimateProtagonist, long heralded and sung about on the 10,000 pages of the Divine Anthology.</p>
