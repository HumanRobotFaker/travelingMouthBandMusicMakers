                “As <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span>’s representative at this meeting,” I said, “I want to relay her communication that she is <i>expressly</i> against the idea of the Penguin Liberation Front being a religious organization.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                We sat in a circle in <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s living room, amongst the crayon-coloured ruins of the former Antarctic palace, whilst <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span>’s big brother <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> brewed tea in the kitchen. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “And I want to <i>second</i> that notion,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, adjusting the pillow upon which he sat. The pillows were originally sewn to serve as comforters for King Leroy’s legion of cats that he apparently kept as pets. “Not for any iconoclastic sentiments, but rather in the interest of <i>symmetry</i>: I think it’s more fitting for King Leroy’s profluent, cacophonic cornucopia of polyreligions to be juxtaposed against a sterile, ignostic, materialist point-of-view.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> raised her hand. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Yes?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said. Nearby, <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="loretta-id">Loretta</span> seemed to lie sleeping as she gnawed on what looked like a glorified cur-chew toy.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I think <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span>’s notion about artistic symmetry is <i>nice</i>, but a bit hackneyed and archaic, considering it serving in the conceptual role of <b>false dichotomy</b>,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> said. “Why can’t there be more diversity on the side of the Penguin Liberation Front? After all, aren’t many realWorldRevolutionaries™ theologically-inclined?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Maybe there could be multiple factions of the Penguin Liberation Front?” I suggested. “After all, isn’t half the fun of having a resistance is to have intra-resistance in-fighting?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil Chavez</span> walked into the living room and laughed, as he dangled four empty mugs on his left hand fingers, whilst carrying a ceramic tea kettle in his right hand. “Ah, that reminds me of my university days,” he said. He set each mug in front of everyone and then poured brown tea into each one.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> shrugged. “Compromise suggestion: can we have the vanguard and the dominant majority be ignostic antitheists, whilst a small, secret minority harbor bizarre religious practices that attempt to uplift the political struggle to one of cosmic proportions?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> smiled. “That sounds good to me.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, “And if the storyline progresses to have King Leroy’s kingdom toppled, we can have a nice little domestic skirmish between the PLF subfactions.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Sounds settled,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> said, as he sat down and sipped the hot tea. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                An AutoAlgoAdvisor app (focused on nonverbal body communication) alerted me to a strangeness in <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span>’s proximity to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span>. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> immediately t-t’d what my algo already noticed. “Note the creeper creepin’ on <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span>.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I almost t-t’d about <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="khali-id">Khali</span> always ranting about <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="hector-id">Hector</span> being creepy, but then remembered she often “joked” the same thing about me.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                Instead I attempted to t-t <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> but, per usual, she wasn’t wearing her iContacts™.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Well,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> responded to <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span>, “<i>that part’s</i> settled. But now we should brainstorm what the specifics of the secret rebellion religion <i>are</i>. Should we utilize real religious concepts like rogue elements of yeshianism, shamshounism, maniites, autochthonous traditions, et cetera?”

                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> began to gaze directly at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> in this creepy, unbroken manner that I’ve seen in cult leader documentaries. He opened his mouth to speak, but <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> broke in.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “<span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span>, is your wife religious?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> asked
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> blinked. “Sort of…”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “What’s your wife’s name?” I asked.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Omusupe,” he said. “We’re technically separated right now.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Oh no,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> said. “What happened?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> paused. “I have addiction issues. I recently went to a rehab in southeast FLEUR.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> said, “didn’t you say you were addicted to suhtawree?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> nodded. 
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “Why would you <i>do that?</i>” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> asked. “You know how many people've been killed by that stuff in the past year?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> t-t’d me: “technically, it’s not suhtawree that is killing these people; but rather the illegality of suhtawree leads to there being an indeterminate amount of the active ingredient in any given massed package; furthermore, the other aspects mixed in the package can be indeterminate in nature and amount.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> nodded. “It was pretty stupid and selfish of me, I know.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So why did you do that stuff?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> asked again.
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “I can theorize,” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> said. “But I am not sure it’s helpful to try and pinpoint a singular reason. I think it’s more helpful just to assume there’re a confluence of reasons that swell and shrink in importance at any given moment.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                “So are you clean?” <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> asked. “Are you still under the spell of the suhtawree?”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> smiled weakly. “I think it’s considered hubris to assume that I’m free at this point. But I’m working on it. But enough about me: let’s keep focusing on these religiously inspired insurrectionists within Antarctica.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="paola-id">Påola</span> continued gazing at <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="brazil-id">Brazil</span> with sympathetic eyes. <span class="popup-inducer" popup-id="winfield-id">Winfield</span> t-t’d: “I think our attempt to obstruct the creeping only aided and abetted.”
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                I shrugged. After all, [redacted].
