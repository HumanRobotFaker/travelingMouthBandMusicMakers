            <a href="uriahletter01.html">Uriah wrote me a letter</a>. 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29. I read it, shoved it in a drawer, and forgot about it. I went to Hector's temple. I took my cousin Khali as a buffer; she said she wanted to attend as part of an anthropological study. "Look at these filthy blancos, all hunched over, rolling dice outta copper cups into silver bowls, frantically marking chicken scratches onto the chalkboard, so they can roll the dice again." We weren't EUByeshians™, so we were out-grouped into merely watching Hector perform the s'posedly sacrosanct ritual. The din and clamour of the dice-rolling into silver bowls was deafening. In the past, Hector wrote that the noise allowed him to transcend and transmute all mortal concerns that plagued his mind. "Nihilism," Khali said when I told her this tidbit. "Nihilism, this dice-throwing, no-thinking business."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "That's a bit close-minded," I said.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Khali shrugged. She pulled out a lanyard pack of composite numbers, featuring prime number trees. 14 being broken down into 2*7, 28 'coming 7*4 and 4 'comin' 2*2. An infinite hammering of everything down to its elemental constituents. Khali flipped through the laminated cards, hole-punched and dangling from the welded-shut ring clamp. All the EUB faithful wore shoals of their favourite "ismoers", a particular structure of prime number factorization tree. Some people preferred symmetry, and some preferred rambling disorder. One woman, a couple rows ahead of us, wore <B>210</B> = 6*35 = 2*3*5*7.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Numerological pseudo-science," Khali muttered.
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Do you think numbers are a real thing?" I asked. "Are they rooted in objective reality? Or just subjective palimpsest we overlay atop everything?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Don't try to redirect me into navel-gazing."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "I'm not trying to redirect. I'm sincerely asking."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Asking if Ahuramazda thinks in numbers?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "Yeah, I guess."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Khali shook her head. "Blasphemous speculation."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            I laughed despite myself. A teenager glanced back as the dice rolling continued unabated. "Your selective religiosity is ridiculous. Didn't you suggest the other day that Ahuramazda and [Angramainya] were bitter former incestuous lovers who split after one gomohed the other with too many newtons?"
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            Khali gave me the side eye. "That was former me. I barely know the gal."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "How convenient."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            "I am not a slave to consistency. Or rationality."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            "How convenient."
            <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
            The dice rolling, at the wave of a flag, ceased almost immediately. Then a sequence of vocal ejaculations occurred. "4", "7", "3", "5", "11", "6", "6", "7", one-by-one, the people shouted out the sum of their two dice, from the southeast corner of the temple down to the southwest corner, before snaking around into the next row and heading the opposite direction. When the declarations reached [Khali and myself], our surrounding folks read their numbers without missing a beat or waiting for us to respond.
