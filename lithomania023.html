        Khali came over a few days later, unannounced, and Jakob answered the door in a neolithic fur outfit.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
        “The great prophet is asleep, transversing the dream world, in search of a new prophecy for our great kingdom!” Jakob explained. 
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    
        “Oh?”
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   
        “But come! Build! Build!” Jakob led her into what was formerly a living room, but now was an empty room covered in that plastic flooring designed to contain radioactive radon underneath everyone’s basements. A dozen people sat around, molding clay figurines. 
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
        So Khali sat down and built tetrahedrons out of clay.
        <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

                The boys tattooed their faces with Bic™ pens (blue, red, black…), and started speaking of the fire godd. 
                <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
“The fire can’t burn stone,” Jakob said. “But other, weaker godds,  are obliterated.”
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
“Good point!” Andy said.
<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
Jakob drew on Luuk’s face. “Our great lucid dream prophet might pay great heed if he sought ‘em out in the dream realm.”
